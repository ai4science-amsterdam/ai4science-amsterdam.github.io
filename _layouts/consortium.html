    <p>The AI4Science Laboratory is the center of a rapidly growing
    multidisciplinary consortium of students, researchers, and experts
    interested in the development and application of artificial
    intelligence tools for the analysis of scientific data. We keep
    each other informed about interesting challenges and new
    developments. Our activities include organising <a href="events.html">seminars and
    workshops</a>, assisting or working together on research ranging from fundamental
    science to practical implementation, and helping each other with acquiring funding for
    AI4Science spin-offs. Are you interested in joining the AI4Science
    consortium?</p>

    <p>
    The AI4Science Laboratory is located in the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-science/contact-and-location/campus/facilities.html">UvA Science Park
    building</a>, with a main office in the <a
    href="https://ivi.uva.nl/">Informatics Institute</a>. But our
    research projects are always connected to experiments in vastly
    different scientific research domains, which are located in the different
    FNWI institures. Currently, we have projects in:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://api.uva.nl/">The Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy</a>
      <li> <a href="https://sils.uva.nl/">The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics</a>
      <li> <a href="https://iop.uva.nl/">The Institute of Physics</a>
      <li> <a href="https://ibed.uva.nl/">The Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences</a>
      <li> <a href="https://hims.uva.nl/">The Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences</a>
    </ul>
