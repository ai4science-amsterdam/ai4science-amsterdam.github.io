description: "Peregrine is a new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad classes of gravitational wave signal. We show that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants (SEOBNRv4PHM).

PhD research of **Benjamin Miller**

The breakthrough discovery of the first gravitational wave signal in
September 2015 (Nobel Prize 2017) has opened a new window to the
Universe. Analyses of the signal waveforms during the initial
inspiral, merger and final ringdown phase provide crucial information
about the properties of superheavy stellar objects. 

Joint work with [Samaya Nissanke][1], [Christoph Weniger][2], and [Patrick Forr√©][3].
