Speaker: **Frank Noé**, Professor, Freie Universität Berlin

**Abstract:** <br/>
Frank Noé will talk about the sampling problem of many-body physics systems and introduce some statistics and machine-learning methods to tackle it. In particular, he will make an introduction to Boltzmann-generating flows, a combination of normalizing flows and statistical-mechanics-based reweighting, and stochastic normalizing flows. Some open questions and unsolved machine-learning problems related to Boltzmann-generating flows will be presented.
