Speaker: **Eliu Huerta Escudero**, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

**Abstract:** <br/>
In this talk I will describe disruptive advances I have pioneered at the interface of domain-inspired AI and extreme scale computing. I will present exemplars on how to scale disruptive advances in AI, distributed computing, and scientific data infrastructure to open new pathways to conduct reproducible, accelerated, data-driven discovery.

**Bio:** <br/>
Eliu Huerta is a theoretical astrophysicist, mathematician and computer scientist with broad research interests. He has done pioneering work at the interface of domain-inspired AI and extreme scale computing for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, Cosmology, Observational Astronomy, and extreme scale simulations that describe multi-scale and multi-physics processes. He is the founding director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Head of the Gravity Group at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. He leads several NSF- and DOE-funded interdisciplinary and multi-institutional projects that focus on disruptive AI applications and advanced computing for big-data physics experiments.
