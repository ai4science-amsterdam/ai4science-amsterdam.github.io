Sampling is a fundamental part of scientific computation and modern AI
applications.  Modern advances in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, such
as Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorem, can be exploited
to devise more efficient sampling algorithms. See for instance the
work on [stochastic normalizing flows][1] and [this review][2]. In
this project, the student will participate in devising novel sampling
algorithms inspired by nonequilibrium processes, and applying them to
physics applications including the simulation of lattice field
theories. See [this][3] for a recent set of lecture notes.
