From scaling laws to emergent capabilities, modern AI systems, in
particular large language models, display various behaviours that
nobody understands. Statistical mechanics in physics offers a leading
tool to analyse and explain these observed phenomena, and thereby
answering some of the extremely crucial questions in modern AI theory.
Some references include this [review][1]
article} and this [book][2]. The
student will review the basics of the commonly used methods, delve
into the modern literature, and together with the advisor agree on a
particular problem to tackle, analyse the problem theoretically, and
run small experiments.
