The evolution of massive stars to-
ward their supernovae and remnant compact objects is poorly understood,
especially for very massive stars with initial masses >100 solar masses
(e.g., Brands et al. 2023). How do these stars evolve? What are their
supernova progenitor properties and resulting supernova characteristics?
How massive are the black holes these stars leave behind? We explore
these questions by analysing the emitted light of stars, which allows us
to characterize their properties. In turn, confronting stellar evaluation
models with these measured properties of many stars helps us constrain
the physics that controls the lives of stars, hence furthers our 
understanding of the way stars evolve and end. Progress is severely hampered by
the complexity and CPU-intensive nature of spectral analysis, a problem
that is particularly urgent given upcoming large-scale spectroscopic 
surveys, which will produce thousands of spectra of massive stars in galaxies
in the Local Group and beyond. In this MSc project, we will develop
a neural network (NN) approach to predict the spectra of massive stars.
Exploratory NN-predictions of the spectra of these stars considering five 
stellar properties have yielded very promising results. Higher dimensional
analysis (considering many more stellar properties) now needs to be 
developed, tested, explored and optimized. Developing a versatile and robust
NN methodology for massive stars in the range 8-300 solar masses is the
goal of this project. This is a great project for a student whoâ€™s excited
about stars and interested in delving deeper into how we can use machine
learning in astrophysical modelling, and would like to tinker with some
neural networks.
