The AI4Science Kickoff Workshop aims to bring junior and expert
researchers together that share the interest in artificial
intelligence developments for scientific discovery. Several invited
speakers working on the forefronts of combining data science with
e.g. systems biology, particle physics, molecular modeling, and
astrophysics, will talk about intriguing scientific challenges and
their latest developments to tackle them.
We also take this moment to announce and celebrate the completion of this
stage of the AI4Science Laboratory. Five PhD students that started
their research projects in the last months will briefly highlight the
current state-of-the-art and their future perspective on using AI in
their respective scientific domains. 
Virtual workshop hosted by [ELLIS][3].
 
 * When: 8 July 2020
 * Where: Science Park, University of Amsterdam
