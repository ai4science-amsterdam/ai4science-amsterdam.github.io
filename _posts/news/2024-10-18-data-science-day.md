Discover the diverse applications, methodological innovations, and societal impact of data science and AI at the University of Amsterdam’s Data Science Day on 18 October! Researchers and experts from UvA and beyond will showcase cutting-edge data science projects through presentations and workshops.

Join us for presentations by:

* **Prof. dr. Paul Groth**, scientific director Data Science Centre
* **Dr. Bernd Ensing**, director FNWI AI4Science Laboratory

followed by a panel discussion with our speakers and

* **Dr. Daniela Huppenkothen**, staff researcher at SRON Netherlands and Data Science fellow at the University of Washington
* **Prof. Alfons Hoekstra**, scientific director of the new FNWI Molecular and Material Design hub

This event delves into the evolving role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in scientific research, exploring the intersection of AI with various disciplines, including physics, humanities, social sciences, mathematics, and biology. Participants will gain insights into how AI is transforming the scientific process, from uncovering new research areas to enhancing dissemination of results. The session will also highlight key challenges such as reproducibility, transparency, and interpretation, as well as broader ethical and societal concerns surrounding AI in science. Discussions will cover the impact of AI on science and the science systems. This event offers a comprehensive platform for exploring AI’s potential while addressing the hurdles that come with its integration into scientific practices.
