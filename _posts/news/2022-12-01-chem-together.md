Chem Together is the place to meet with professionals from your field
of expertise. We like to think of this event as an idea market, a
place where you can share and exchange opinions on interesting
projects and new trends in Chemistry for Sustainability and Chemistry
for Life Sciences. This edition the topic is "Chemistry meets
Artificial Intelligence". 
Hosted by the [Amsterdam Chemistry Network][2].

* When: 1 December 2022
