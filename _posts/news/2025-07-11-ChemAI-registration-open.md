A lecture series on *machine learning in physics* is organised by [Dr. Christoph Weniger][1] focused on such topics as equivariant neural networks, simulation-based inference, and transformers. Each event is scheduled for 90 minutes, in which the first 60 minutes will feature local or national speakers introducing a topic, followed by short talks from MSc/PhD students or postdocs on related applications. The final 30 minutes will be an optional crash course on how to use the presented techniques in practice, using Google Colab notebooks.
