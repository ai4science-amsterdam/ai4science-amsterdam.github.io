#  #text: 'An active field of research in astronomy deals with recognising rare features in data streams from space obervations in (almost) real time. This challenging task arises from the massive imaging surveys of the sky carried our at a wide range of wavelengths (optical, radio, X-ray). The purpose is no longer just to find objects that are there all or most of the time, but also to spot so-called ‘transient’ objects that appear only fleetingly.'

#text:'Two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) is a powerful technique to separate and detect trace molecular compounds in complex samples such as food contaminants, industrial production streams, urine, or blood, to name but a few examples. However, successful implementation requires time-consuming experiment-specific optimization of many parameters. Machine learning can aid with data-analysis and the acceleration of optimization.'

<center> <h1>The AI4Science Kickoff Workshop</h1> </center>

The AI4Science Kickoff Workshop will be a virtual workshop hosted by the Ellis Society. Ellis is the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems. The workshop will be held on Wednesday, July 8, with help of video conferencing tools. Local and international invited speakers will give lectures. Registration is free of charge.

<center> <h2>How can we detect, classify, and predict relevant patterns in scientific data if they are hidden within large amount of non-relevant data?</h2> </center>

The AI4Science Laboratory is an initiative supported by the Faculty of Exact Sciences (FNWI) at the University of Amsterdam and located in the Informatics Institute (IvI). The AI4Science Lab is also connected to AMLAB, the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab.

We develop and use machine learning techniques to discover patterns in data streams produced by experiments in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from ecology to molecular biology and from chemistry to astrophysics.
