		<description>The AI4Science Lab is an initiative supported by the Faculty of Exact Sciences (FNWI) at the University of Amsterdam and located in the Informatics Institute (IvI). The AI4Science Lab is also connected to AMLAB, the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab.
We develop and use machine learning techniques to discover patterns in data streams produced by experiments in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from ecology to molecular biology and from chemistry to astrophysics.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Cell Biology revolves around the idea that cells are core functional units of organisms: Models for cellular function explain many disease and treatment effects, for example. Hence, there has been a long-standing, significant interest in improving the understanding of cellular behaviour. Recent experimental advances enable increasingly detailed molecular profiling of cells: Examples include methods such as single-cell RNA sequencing, which measure quantities of particular molecular species in each cell. The resulting output can be summarised as a matrix (cells x molecular features) with up to millions of cells and 10,000s of features. Models for variance in these data sets are actively developed in Computational Biology; many concepts from unsupervised learning are used in this context. While these unsupervised techniques yield useful descriptions of the molecular state space, they usually fail to yield a complete picture of molecular mechanisms of causality underlying this variance. Here, I discuss approaches centred on supervision tasks in single-cell Immunology which improve interpretability of these models and outline ways of generalising this approach to other settings in single-cell Biology. Lastly, I discuss challenges and opportunities of representation learning on whole tissues, bridging the gap from cell-centric models to tissue function models, such as for tumor behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Optical images of galaxy-galaxy lensing systems carry information about the small scale structure of dark matter. Although the underlying physics is simple, the large uncertainties regarding the surface brightness of the source galaxy as well as the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy make these images notoriously difficult to model and to analyse. In order to tackle this difficult task, we developed a new analysis pipeline that makes use of a whole arsenal of modern machine learning techniques: variational inference, probabilistic programming, Gaussian processes, and neural likelihood-to-ratio estimation. I will present the current state of our work, discuss remaining challenges, as well as opportunities for similar astronomical image analysis problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In the last five years, neural networks have emerged as a dominant paradigm for constructing generative models of images and sound data. However, challenges remain when building generative models for molecules. Since molecules are made of collections of indistinguishable particles, they are symmetric to permutation, a symmetry not respected by basic neural network architectures. While neural networks have been constructed that obey permutation symmetry using message-passing ideas, these architectures rely on knowing the molecular structure in advance, limiting their use for generative models. Here, we introduce a new approach that constructs molecular graphs using permutation-equivariant layers formed by convolutions over the group of permutations. Using these layers, we are able to construct a variational autoencoder that preserves permutational symmetry from input to output. This allows for direct comparison of the inputs to the outputs, avoiding the requirement to solve a potentially costly graph matching problem. Our architecture is able to achieve results comparable to other competing architectures using considerably less domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Advanced statistical methods are rapidly impregnating many scientific fields, offering new perspectives on long-standing problems. In materials science, data-driven methods are already bearing fruit in various disciplines, such as hard condensed matter or inorganic chemistry, as well as soft matter to a smaller extent.
When coupling machine learning to molecular simulations, many problems of interest display dauntingly-large interpolation spaces, limiting their immediate application without undesired artifacts (e.g., extrapolation). The incorporation of physical information, such as conserved quantities, symmetries, and constraints, can play a decisive role in reducing the interpolation space. Conversely, physics can help determine whether a machine-learning prediction should be trusted, acting as a more robust alternative to the predictive variance.
In this talk I will show how incorporating physics in machine-learning models can help connect resolutions in multiscale modeling. Illustrations will include force-field parametrization, automated dimensionality reduction and clustering, and generative models to reintroduce atomistic detail in coarse-grained configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
