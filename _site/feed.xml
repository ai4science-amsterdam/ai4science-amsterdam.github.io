&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science-Guided AI or Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods allow for the automatic discovery of mechanistic models by infusing neural network training into the simulation process. In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that SciML is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems. The viewers will leave with an understanding of how compiler techniques are being infused into the simulation stack to increasingly automate the process of developing mechanistic models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../people/JanWillemVanDeMeent.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;JanWillem&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-right: 10px; border-radius:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: &lt;strong&gt;Jan-Willem van de Meent&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Professor (UHD), AMLab, University of Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep probabilistic programming systems combine the principles of deep learning with the principles of probabilistic modeling. The user programmatically specifies a deep generative model (a neural mapping from latent variables to data), along with a corresponding inference model (a neural mapping from data to latent variables), which together can be trained using stochastic gradient descent with little or no supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss recent innovations in training deep probabilistic programs by combining techniques from variational inference and importance sampling. For many years, deep generative models were typically trained by maximizing a reparameterized lower bound, as is done in variational autoencoders. However, this approach can fail to converge to a meaningful representation in more structured problems, such as tasks the involve reasoning about shared features for a small batch of inputs. I will discuss how we can overcome these difficulties, using variational methods that learn proposals for importance samplers, as well as a programming abstractions for high-level specification of such methods in probabilistic programming systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: &lt;strong&gt;Saer Samanipour&lt;/strong&gt;, Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam and honorary research fellow at the UQ, Australia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High resolution mass spectrometry is one of the main tools for chemical characterization of complex samples. The samples analyzed with this instrument result into large datasets comprising of up to 8.0e12 variables that could potentially carry crucial structural information about the sample chemistry. At the same time there are different sources of signal redundancy in such datasets. In this talk I will present two case studies where machine learning enables the removal of the data redundancy without any information loss. The first case study will discuss the seamless conversion from the profile mode to centroided and vice versa. In this case, we developed a self adjusting centroiding algorithm to detect and extract the meaningful information in such complex datasets. Additionally, a regression model was developed to convert the extracted information to the raw data. The second case study, is related to the development of a stochastic classification model to detect the isotopic signal in the mass spectra and therefore increase the level of confidence in the generated identifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The ability to rapidly learn from high-dimensional data to make reliable predictions about the future is crucial in many contexts. This could be a fly avoiding predators, or the retina processing terabytes of data guiding complex human actions. Modern day artificial intelligence (AI) aims to mimic this fidelity and has been successful in many domains of life. It is tempting to ask if AI could also be used to understand and predict the dynamics of complex molecules with millions of atoms. In this talk I will show that certain flavors of AI can indeed help us understand generic molecular dynamics and also predict it even in situations with arbitrary long memories. However this requires close integration of AI with old and new ideas in statistical mechanics. I will talk about such methods developed by my group (1-3). I will demonstrate the methods on different problems, where we predict mechanisms at timescales much longer than milliseconds while keeping all-atom/femtosecond resolution. These include ligand dissociation from flexible protein/RNA and crystal nucleation with competing polymorphs. I will conclude by discussing some generic challenges and  solutions regarding reliability, interpretability and extrapolative powers of AI when used to guide and complement simulations and perhaps even experiments in chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFF) should be accurate, efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof. The first step toward ensuring broad applicability and reliability of MLFFs requires a robust conceptual understanding of how to map interacting electrons to interacting “atoms”. Here I discuss two aspects: (1) how electronic interactions are mapped to atoms with a critique of the “electronic nearsightedness” principle, and (2) our developments of symmetry-adapted gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) framework for MLFFs generally applicable for modeling of molecules, materials, and their interfaces. I highlight the key importance of bridging fundamental physical priors and conservation laws with the flexibility of non-linear ML regressors to achieve the challenging goal of constructing chemically-accurate force fields for a broad set of systems. Applications of sGDML will be presented for small and large (bio/DNA) molecules, pristine and realistic solids, and interfaces between molecules and 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
One of the fundamental objectives in both science and machine learning is to predict the outcomes of actions in order to improve decision-making. As our primary application, we will consider predicting the effect of a drug on gene expression, where the effect may depend heavily on cell type.
 Ideally, we would separately measure the effect of each drug on every cell type, but this is infeasible due to the massive number of drugs and cell types. Instead, we take the approach of extrapolating these effects from a small number of measured outcomes. In this talk, I will present a simple structural model under which this extrapolation is justified, i.e., the effect of a drug in a new cell type can be identified from existing data. Motivated by this model, I will introduce a computationally efficient method for predicting the effect of a drug on gene expression. I will show that the proposed model and method are particularly effective on the prominent Connectivity Map dataset, which measures the effects of over 20,000 small molecules across 70 cell types. Finally, I will end with a discussion of broader scientific applications of the proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
With the continual improvement of computing hardware and algorithms, simulations have become a powerful tool for understanding all sorts of (bio)molecular processes. To handle the large simulation data sets and to accelerate slow, activated transitions, a condensed set of descriptors, or collective variables (CVs), is needed to discern the relevant dynamics that describes the molecular process of interest. However, proposing an adequate set of CVs that can capture the intrinsic reaction coordinate of the molecular transition is often extremely difficult. Here, we present a framework to find an optimal set of CVs from a pool of candidates using a combination of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. The approach effectively replaces the encoder of an autoencoder network with genes to represent the latent space, i.e., the CVs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Empirical scientific research bounds inferred values of physical constants using posteriors marginalized over nuisance parameters. In a likelihood-based approach, the marginal posterior is usually sampled by marginalizing over samples from the joint posterior. This method suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the necessity of a tractable likelihood function. We introduce a set of algorithms which approximate any marginal posterior of interest directly and efficiently. The basis is neural likelihood-free (simulation-based) inference using likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation. We increase simulator efficiency by constraining the prior using an indicator function. In this way, we learn an amortized estimate of the target posterior. In addition, we propose a method for principled reuse of simulated data based on an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. These algorithms were designed with the practical needs of computational physics in mind. Specifically targeting the regime of slow simulators and narrow target posteriors.
The talk itself will focus on the details of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13951&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; which introduced these methods. You can find an implementation of the method on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/undark-lab/swyft&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Life sciences is a fascinating field that tries to answer fundamental questions about ourselves, other species, and interactions within and among various environments. (Bio)chemistry and physics are typical tools to study and comprehend our world. However, due to the high complexity of biological systems, standard tools are not enough to understand and model all underlying relationships. Computational methods could serve as a possible remedy to that. In this talk, I will show how we can use computational intelligence, Bayesian inference, and deep learning to deal with some problems in life sciences. Specifically, we will discuss how to identify parameters in dynamical models of biological networks, how to find values of kinetic parameters in enzyme kinetics (including COVID-19), and how to count cells automatically&lt;/p&gt;
