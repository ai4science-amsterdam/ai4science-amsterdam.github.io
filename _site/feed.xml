		<description>The AI4Science Laboratory is an initiative supported by the Faculty of Exact Sciences (FNWI) at the University of Amsterdam and located in the Informatics Institute (IvI). The AI4Science Lab is also connected to AMLAB, the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab.
We develop and use machine learning techniques to discover patterns in data streams produced by experiments in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from ecology to molecular biology and from chemistry to astrophysics.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: &lt;strong&gt;Tristan Bereau&lt;/strong&gt;, Assistant professor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bereau.group/&quot;&gt;Computational Soft Matter&lt;/a&gt;, HIMS, UvA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Advanced statistical methods are rapidly impregnating many scientific fields, offering new perspectives on long-standing problems. In materials science, data-driven methods are already bearing fruit in various disciplines, such as hard condensed matter or inorganic chemistry, as well as soft matter to a smaller extent.
When coupling machine learning to molecular simulations, many problems of interest display dauntingly-large interpolation spaces, limiting their immediate application without undesired artifacts (e.g., extrapolation). The incorporation of physical information, such as conserved quantities, symmetries, and constraints, can play a decisive role in reducing the interpolation space. Conversely, physics can help determine whether a machine-learning prediction should be trusted, acting as a more robust alternative to the predictive variance.
In this talk I will show how incorporating physics in machine-learning models can help connect resolutions in multiscale modeling. Illustrations will include force-field parametrization, automated dimensionality reduction and clustering, and generative models to reintroduce atomistic detail in coarse-grained configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
