&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFF) should be accurate, efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof. The first step toward ensuring broad applicability and reliability of MLFFs requires a robust conceptual understanding of how to map interacting electrons to interacting “atoms”. Here I discuss two aspects: (1) how electronic interactions are mapped to atoms with a critique of the “electronic nearsightedness” principle, and (2) our developments of symmetry-adapted gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) framework for MLFFs generally applicable for modeling of molecules, materials, and their interfaces. I highlight the key importance of bridging fundamental physical priors and conservation laws with the flexibility of non-linear ML regressors to achieve the challenging goal of constructing chemically-accurate force fields for a broad set of systems. Applications of sGDML will be presented for small and large (bio/DNA) molecules, pristine and realistic solids, and interfaces between molecules and 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
One of the fundamental objectives in both science and machine learning is to predict the outcomes of actions in order to improve decision-making. As our primary application, we will consider predicting the effect of a drug on gene expression, where the effect may depend heavily on cell type.
 Ideally, we would separately measure the effect of each drug on every cell type, but this is infeasible due to the massive number of drugs and cell types. Instead, we take the approach of extrapolating these effects from a small number of measured outcomes. In this talk, I will present a simple structural model under which this extrapolation is justified, i.e., the effect of a drug in a new cell type can be identified from existing data. Motivated by this model, I will introduce a computationally efficient method for predicting the effect of a drug on gene expression. I will show that the proposed model and method are particularly effective on the prominent Connectivity Map dataset, which measures the effects of over 20,000 small molecules across 70 cell types. Finally, I will end with a discussion of broader scientific applications of the proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
With the continual improvement of computing hardware and algorithms, simulations have become a powerful tool for understanding all sorts of (bio)molecular processes. To handle the large simulation data sets and to accelerate slow, activated transitions, a condensed set of descriptors, or collective variables (CVs), is needed to discern the relevant dynamics that describes the molecular process of interest. However, proposing an adequate set of CVs that can capture the intrinsic reaction coordinate of the molecular transition is often extremely difficult. Here, we present a framework to find an optimal set of CVs from a pool of candidates using a combination of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. The approach effectively replaces the encoder of an autoencoder network with genes to represent the latent space, i.e., the CVs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Empirical scientific research bounds inferred values of physical constants using posteriors marginalized over nuisance parameters. In a likelihood-based approach, the marginal posterior is usually sampled by marginalizing over samples from the joint posterior. This method suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the necessity of a tractable likelihood function. We introduce a set of algorithms which approximate any marginal posterior of interest directly and efficiently. The basis is neural likelihood-free (simulation-based) inference using likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation. We increase simulator efficiency by constraining the prior using an indicator function. In this way, we learn an amortized estimate of the target posterior. In addition, we propose a method for principled reuse of simulated data based on an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. These algorithms were designed with the practical needs of computational physics in mind. Specifically targeting the regime of slow simulators and narrow target posteriors.
The talk itself will focus on the details of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13951&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; which introduced these methods. You can find an implementation of the method on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/undark-lab/swyft&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Life sciences is a fascinating field that tries to answer fundamental questions about ourselves, other species, and interactions within and among various environments. (Bio)chemistry and physics are typical tools to study and comprehend our world. However, due to the high complexity of biological systems, standard tools are not enough to understand and model all underlying relationships. Computational methods could serve as a possible remedy to that. In this talk, I will show how we can use computational intelligence, Bayesian inference, and deep learning to deal with some problems in life sciences. Specifically, we will discuss how to identify parameters in dynamical models of biological networks, how to find values of kinetic parameters in enzyme kinetics (including COVID-19), and how to count cells automatically&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Summer, with most biological and agricultural production, is probably the season when future changes in extremes will have the most-severe impacts on humanity. Summer extremes are particularly devastating when they persist for several days: Many consecutive hot-and-dry days causing harvest failure, or stagnating wet extremes causing flooding. Often such situations are related to quasi-stationary waves in the Jetstream. Despite this importance, we are far from a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in creating such quasi-stationary waves, nor how they will change with future warming. Using machine learning techniques based on causal inference we can understand and quantify the drivers and causal pathways that influence jet dynamics. I will present several examples of how causal inference techniques can disentangle cause from effect to provide insights into the dynamics of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and teleconnections. Understanding the physical pathways in atmosphere by quantifying causal links can help improving forecasts on seasonal to sub-seasonal timescales including prolonged extremes like heat waves and droughts. Some of these data-driven forecasts using machine learning outperform operational forecasts based on dynamical models. Ultimately we aim for developing hybrid forecast methods to improve early warning of extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Dark matter halos are the fundamental building blocks of cosmic large-scale structure. Improving our theoretical understanding of their evolution and formation is an essential step towards understanding how galaxies form. I will present a deep learning model, based on 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained to learn the mapping between the initial conditions and the final dark matter halos of an N-body simulation. The CNN is able to extract directly from the initial density field the features that are relevant to halo formation. Our goal is to utilize machine learning for knowledge extraction: we aim to gain new physical understanding of halo formation by extracting information from the deep learning model regarding the underlying physics of halo collapse. To do this, we first compare the performance of the deep learning algorithm to that of machine learning models whose predictions depend only on physically-motivated features extracted from the initial conditions. I will then present ongoing work on interpreting the features learnt by the deep learning model in relation to physical properties of the initial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
