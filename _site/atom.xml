&lt;p&gt;PhD research of &lt;strong&gt;Abhay Nagaraj&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim to  investigate the catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) on transition metal surfaces. This reaction is a key step in the development of sustainable technologies for CO₂ capture and conversion. Our approach leverages Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs)—a powerful and rapidly evolving tool in computational chemistry. MLIPs enable us to model complex chemical processes with near ab initio accuracy, while dramatically extending the time and length scales accessible compared to traditional quantum mechanical methods. This is particularly valuable for studying heterogeneous catalysis, where the interaction between molecules and surfaces involves subtle electronic and structural effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in understanding CO₂ reduction lies in modeling the electron transfer processes that drive the reaction. Electrons, being quantum in nature, are notoriously difficult to simulate directly, especially over extended simulations. MLIPs offer an efficient way to study these interactions, allowing us to explore catalytic mechanisms that were previously computationally prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining ML-based simulations with experimental insights from our ANION collaborators, this research aims to uncover a more detailed picture of the CO₂ reduction pathway and its dependence on surface composition and structure. Ultimately, our goal is to support the design of more efficient catalysts and contribute to the advancement of green, carbon-neutral chemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>Structure–property relationship exploration for nitrogen reduction catalysis</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="http://127.0.0.1:4000//research/matilde-mercuri1/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../members/MatildeMercuri.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Matilde Mercuri&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-right: 10px; border-radius:50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhD research of &lt;strong&gt;Matilde Mercuri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen fixation is a crucial process in the biological cycle, as it provides organisms with ammonia (NH₃), a fundamental precursor for nucleic acids and amino acids. In nature, this transformation is carried out by specialized microorganisms using the enzyme nitrogenase, while in industry it is achieved via the Haber–Bosch process, an energy-intensive method operating under high temperature and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the search for more sustainable and selective catalytic alternatives, homogeneous catalysts, such as coordination complexes, have emerged as promising molecular platforms for N₂ reduction under milder conditions. Unlike heterogeneous systems, homogeneous catalysts offer well-defined active sites that can be fine-tuned at the molecular level through ligand modification. This tunability enables chemists to systematically modulate the electronic and steric properties of the metal center to promote N₂ activation and facilitate multi-electron transfer during reduction reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the design of homogeneous catalysts has relied on empirical trial-and-error approaches. Although several successful systems have emerged, the vast combinatorial space of metal–ligand architectures renders conventional experimental methods inefficient. Moreover, the high computational cost of simulating electronic properties and reaction pathways using quantum chemistry has further slowed the pace of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, we aim to develop a computational workflow that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning to accelerate the discovery of homogeneous nitrogen fixation catalysts. This approach will leverage enhanced sampling techniques and neural-network-based interatomic potentials to efficiently explore the potential energy surface, enabling the systematic evaluation of catalytic performance across chemical space. By generating a dataset of coordination complexes annotated with key descriptors, we aim to establish a foundation for predictive machine learning models capable of proposing novel metal–ligand architectures optimized for nitrogen reduction activity. In doing so, we seek to move toward a data-driven framework for the rational design of homogeneous catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phd-thesis-summary&quot;&gt;PhD thesis summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, deep learning for scientific applications has gained signifi- cant attention with applications in a wide range of fields, including chemistry, biology, physics, and astronomy. This thesis explores the use of geometric, temporal, or other inductive biases for (scientific) deep learning. It is broadly divided into two parts: the first part focuses on structured deep learning, while the second part discusses certain applications in astrophysics. Each chapter tackles different challenges and research questions, which we outline below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start the structured deep learning part with a novel self-supervised algo- rithm for time-series particle filter models. The models resulting from this method can be applied to a wide range of fields where data is noisy and the underlying dynamics are unknown. Moreover, we can effectively incorpo- rate expert scientific knowledge and are able to perform exact inference while remaining efficient and expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../images/thesis_david-ruhe.png&quot; alt=&quot;thesis&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second chapter introduces geometric algebra-based neural networks for modeling dynamical systems. By parameterizing linear transformations as compositions of symmetry group actions, the network is able to faithfully learn the transformation laws of the underlying dynamical system. This parameter- ization shows its strength in the context of rigid body dynamics as well as fluid mechanics simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter three, we propose Clifford Group-Equivariant Neural Net- works for learning frame-agnostic data representations. Due to the generality of the framework, these models can be applied to problems in various dimen- sions considering a variety of symmetry groups including the Lorentz group often used in relativistic (astro)physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth chapter introduces Rolling Diffusion Models for learning gen- erative models of time-series data such as video or scientific simulations. Es- pecially when the temporal dynamics are complex, the model shows improved performance compared to existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part two of the thesis, we first propose a deep learning-backed algorithm for hunting transient radio sources without any kind of supervised learning or human intervention. It constructs an end-to-end pipeline that con- sumes imaged radio interferometric data from LOFAR’s AARTFAAC system and produces a catalog of transient radio sources. Due to the low frequency regime, high noise levels, the high dimensionality and dispersed signals, it fills a methodological gap for this subfield, especially in light of the upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we explore using normalizing flows to infer gravitational wave parameters from the noisy data of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. It is shown that the resulting posterior predictive distributions align well with ex- isting knowledge or simulated ground truth, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and high-dimensional inference in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Date: 5 June 2025
&lt;li&gt;Time: 16:00 hr
&lt;li&gt;Location: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ivi.uva.nl/shared/locaties/en/binnenstad/agnietenkapel.html&quot;&gt;Agnietenkapel&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phd-thesis-summary&quot;&gt;PhD thesis summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, billions of birds migrate across the globe, traveling vast distances in their quest for favorable breeding and wintering conditions, while contributing to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity along the way. At the same time, human activities are transforming our planet at an unprecedented pace, affecting nearly every aspect of life on Earth - including migrating birds. To effectively mitigate the resulting human-wildlife conflicts and protect migration systems around the world, it is essential to better understand migratory behaviors and develop accurate forecasting systems that inform stakeholders about when and where birds will move in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../images/thesis_fiona-lippert.png&quot; alt=&quot;thesis&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weather radars, organized into continental-scale networks, have emerged as a key data source for monitoring migration patterns across entire flyways. Yet, several methodological challenges persist: radar observations are spatially sparse, provide only partial information about movement direction and speed, and are subject to noise and measurement artifacts. Moreover, despite decades of research, our understanding of migration behaviors remains incomplete. This limits our ability to apply traditional geoscientific modeling techniques, which rely on accurate mechanistic process descriptions to infer and forecast the state of partially observed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thesis investigates how partial processes knowledge about the spatio- temporal dynamics of bird migration can be combined with machine learn- ing to address these challenges and harness weather radar data more effec- tively. The work is structured in two complementary parts. Part I focuses on continental-scale forecasting, developing hybrid modeling approaches that combine fluid dynamics principles with deep learning to predict migration patterns. We show how incorporating even basic mechanistic understanding - like the conservation of mass - can improve both prediction accuracy and interpretability. The resulting framework enables new insights into how birds flexibly adjust their take-off decisions across different spatial and temporal contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part II tackles the fundamental challenge of reconstructing local movement patterns from low-level radar measurements. Here, we develop probabilistic frameworks that combine the flexibility of deep learning with graphical models to encode known spatial and temporal dependency structures between variables. Although several challenges remain before these methods can be applied in practice, they represent promising steps toward high-resolution movement reconstruction that features both computational efficiency and uncertainty quantification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, this thesis demonstrates the potential of integrating process knowledge with data-driven machine learning methods to advance the model- ing of complex ecological processes for which both mechanistic understanding and data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although less famous than the quantum version used for electronic
structure calculations, classical density functional theory (cDFT)
remains a very appealing approach to describe fluids. However, similar
as in quantum DFT, the accuracy of the theory is hampered by the lack
of an exact description of the (free) energy functional. Over the
years, various approximations have been developed, albeit with mixed
success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with a team of researchers at the Computational Chemistry Group (Van
‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences) and the AMLab (Informatics
Institute), together with the Debye
Institute for Nanomaterials Science and the Institute for Theoretical
Physics of Utrecht University, we have developed a machine-learned approximation
that can significantly improve cDFT calculations of fluids and
vapours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ‘neural density functional’ can be trained in two manners. The
first approach applies the first functional derivative of the free
energy, which requires for training a large dataset of inhomogeneous
particle densities on a 3D grid computed with Monte Carlo simulations
under various external potentials. This is computationally rather
demanding. The second approach, based on the second functional
derivatives, requires a dataset of only 1D radial distribution
functions of only homogeneous densities. This requires significantly
fewer simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, we were able to show that the second approach
works as well as the first for a simple Lennard-Jones liquid in a 1D
planar symmetry. Work is underway to apply the new method to more
practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ever-increasing computational power and ever-shrinking size of
electronic devices have been enabled by rapid developments in optical
lithography and the micro-electronics industry. State-of-the-art
processors require reliable and fast nanoscale engineering methods
with high production efficiency. The widespread access to
computational power has already made a big impact on our daily
lives. New future applications like VR, AR or AI technologies require
even smaller and more powerful hardware. However, keeping up with the
aggressive reduction of the semiconductor device feature sizes is a
challenging task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we will explore deep learning and Bayesian
optimization techniques to push the boundaries of compact
semiconductor metrology tools. Label-free optical imaging methods with
a spatial resolution beyond the Abbe diffraction limit and a temporal
resolution beyond the Nyquist limit are being developed to
characterize multi-layer nanostructures. Several modern research areas
such as computational imaging and compressive sensing are connected
with cutting-edge Machine Learning tools to develop new methods of
nanoscale imaging and metrology for the semiconductor industry. The
project is running in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://amlab.science.uva.nl/people/PatrickForre/&quot;&gt;Patrick Forré&lt;/a&gt; of AMLab
and the Advanced Research Center
for Nanolithography (ARCNL) and ASML, the world leader in the
production of the lithography machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly contagious viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can have a negative
impact on the health of people and the stability of social
resources. Vaccines are an effective means of stopping the widespread
spread of viruses in the population by giving people immunity to a
particular virus, thereby stopping them from spreading the virus and
protecting those at risk of being infected. One of the core aspects of
vaccine development is the development of antigens. One of the ways in
which antigens are developed is by mutating one/some of the amino
acids in the antigen, thus making the antigen stable, which in turn
triggers an immune response and the production of a large number of
antibodies. Among the methods for finding a viable antigen, the
structural based approach has worked well and is widely used. However,
their success rate for single point variants is only 5% to 10%. As a
result, it can take a considerable amount of time to design a stable
antigen that is feasible with multiple variants. Thanks to the large
amount of available protein structure/sequence data, deep
learning-based approaches have recently achieved unprecedented success
in research for proteins, e.g. protein property prediction and protein
structure prediction. In this project, our goal is to apply the
cutting-edge deep learning methods (e.g. Graph Neural Networks,
Transformers, Equivariant Neural Networks, AlphaFold2 etc…) to model
our problems. Allowing the model to suggest variant sites and variant
amino acids for antigens with correspondingly predicted stabilities,
leading to the help for designing of stable antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causal discovery to reveal complex gene regulation networks from vast
transcriptome datasets Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) model the
biological interactions between genes and provide a better
understanding of the cellular processes and regulation
pathways. Correctly constructed GRNs can play a fundamental role in
solving various biological and biomedical problems, such as tracking
disease development. Technological advances of high-throughput
molecular biology have opened a new research frontier for inferring
GRNs in a completely data-driven way. The great amount of gene
expression data available on the GEO database suggests using AI-based
techniques for processing and modeling such networks. In this project,
we focus on Bacillus subtilis, a well-studied Gram-positive bacterium
with more than 3,000 publicly available transcriptome
datasets. Combining these datasets alongside with reconstructing the
known GRNs can be a very challenging task due to the (un)observable
batch effects in the data that result from the varying data generating
process across experiments. By tackling these issues and applying
novel causal discovery techniques we aim for a better interpretation
of the genes functions and their organization in hierarchical
structures or even revealing unknown regulatory networks.&lt;/p&gt;
