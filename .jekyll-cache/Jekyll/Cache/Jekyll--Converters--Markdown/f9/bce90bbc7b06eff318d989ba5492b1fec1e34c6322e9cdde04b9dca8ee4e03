I" <p>Previously, the FNWI Research Focus Area ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence for Sustainable Molecules and Materials‚Äù (AI4SMM) has granted four kick-off projects that started in the past year as collaborations within different institutes within FNWI. The AI4SMM board has allocated the remaining budget of k‚Ç¨ 1,190 for a single flagship project, to start early 2025.</p>

<p>Currently there are two initiatives known by the board that may qualify for funding as such a flagship project. End November the board will decide to which initiative the funds will be granted. Since the board aims to select from a comprehensive list of eligible initiatives, all scientific staff at FNWI is invited to submit a proposal for a flagship project. The time line is short, so only consortia with already solid commitments who can make a head start are invited to submit.</p>
