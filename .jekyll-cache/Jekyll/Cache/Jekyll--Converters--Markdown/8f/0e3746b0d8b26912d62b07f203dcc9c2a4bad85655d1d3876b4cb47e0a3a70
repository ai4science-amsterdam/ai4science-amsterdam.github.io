<p>Are you a student of a (joined) UvA bachelor or master program and
looking for an exciting research project? The gallery below gives a
compilation of available projects in the various scientific
disciplines taught at the Faculty of Science. If you see an
interesting project, please contact the supervisor of the project.
In case you do not see an interesting match, but you wonder about
other projects (perhaps you have an interesting research idea related
to AI for scientific research yourself), feel free to send an
<a href="mailto:ai4science.info@gmail.com">email inquiry</a> to us.</p>
