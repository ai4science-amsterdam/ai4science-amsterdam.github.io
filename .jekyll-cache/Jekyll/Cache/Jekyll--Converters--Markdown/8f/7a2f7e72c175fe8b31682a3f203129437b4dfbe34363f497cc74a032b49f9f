<h2 id="the-ai4science-colloquium-series">The AI4Science Colloquium Series</h2>

<p>The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium, we invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. During the time of the covid-19 pandemic, the AI4Science colloquia were done online via zoom video conferencing. From 2023 on, the colloquia will be held onsite again, at the UvA Science Park LAB42 building.

<p>Chem Together is the place to meet with professionals from your field
of expertise. We like to think of this event as an idea market, a
place where you can share and exchange opinions on interesting
projects and new trends in Chemistry for Sustainability and Chemistry
for Life Sciences. This edition the topic is “Chemistry meets
Artificial Intelligence”. 
Hosted by the <a href="https://www.acnetwork.nl">Amsterdam Chemistry Network</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ai4science-kickoff-workshop">AI4Science Kickoff Workshop</h4>
<p>The AI4Science Kickoff Workshop aims to bring junior and expert
researchers together that share the interest in artificial
intelligence developments for scientific discovery. Several invited
speakers working on the forefronts of combining data science with
e.g. systems biology, particle physics, molecular modeling, and
astrophysics, will talk about intriguing scientific challenges and
their latest developments to tackle them.
We also take this moment to announce and celebrate the completion of this
stage of the AI4Science Laboratory. Five PhD students that started
their research projects in the last months will briefly highlight the
current state-of-the-art and their future perspective on using AI in
their respective scientific domains. 
Virtual workshop hosted by <a href="https://ellis.eu">ELLIS</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When: 8 July 2020</li>
  <li>Where: Science Park, University of Amsterdam</li>
</ul>
