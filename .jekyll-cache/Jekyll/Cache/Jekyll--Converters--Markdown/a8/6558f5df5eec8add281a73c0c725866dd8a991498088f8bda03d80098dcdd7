I"ø<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly finding their
way into the natural sciences, where they are applied for the analysis of
research data, finding patterns and making predictions. At the same
time, research topics and methodologies initiate the study and development of
new machine learning algorithms. The co-development of both fields is
self-catalyzed by the shared interest in building accurate models and
distribution functions of the highly complex phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>The aim of this AI4Science Symposium is three-fold: (1) show-case
recent progress of artificial intelligence for scientific discovery within
the different FNWI research institutes and outside, (2) bring AI experts and
scientists together to exchange ideas, and (3) explore possibilities for
new collaborations, research projects, and funding opportunities.</p>

<p>Six scientists connected to the different FNWI institutes will give
lectures on how artificial intelligence advances their scientific
research. During the poster sessions, young and senior researchers
can present their results and discuss opportunities for AI models or
scientific research. The symposium concludes with drinks and snacks.</p>

<p>The symposium is open to everyone with an interest in artificial
intelligence for scientific discovery. See below for the program, (free)
registration, and how to contribute a poster.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When: Friday afternoon, 24 February 2023, from 13.00 until 18.30</li>
  <li>Where: Room L1.01, LAB42, Science Park, Amsterdam</li>
