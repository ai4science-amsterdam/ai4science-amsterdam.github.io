<p>A lecture series on <em>machine learning in physics</em> is organised by <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/e/c.weniger/c.weniger.html">Dr. Christoph Weniger</a> focused on such topics as equivariant neural networks, simulation-based inference, and transformers. Each event is scheduled for 90 minutes, in which the first 60 minutes will feature local or national speakers introducing a topic, followed by short talks from MSc/PhD students or postdocs on related applications. The final 30 minutes will be an optional crash course on how to use the presented techniques in practice, using Google Colab notebooks.</p>
