I"}<p>The FNWI Research Priority Area “<em>Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Molecules and Materials” (AI4Sustainability)</em> has opened a call for  pre-proposals to fund <strong>four interdisciplinary 2-year postdoctoral fellow projects</strong>. Applications are to be submitted by potential PD supervisors.</p>

<p>The AI4Sustainability RPA is focused on connecting and advancing two research areas that are already core strengths at the UvA Faculty of Science and will, in combination, have an important societal impact: (1) development and application of artifical intelligence and deep learning for data analysis and pattern recognition and (2)  design and utilisation of more sustainable molecules and materials for the transition to a circular economy. AI4Sustainability is formed by researchers from the FNWI institutes the <a href="https://hims.uva.nl">Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences</a> (HIMS), the <a href="https://ivi.uva.nl">Institute of Physics</a> (IoP), the <a href="https://iop.uva.nl">Informatics Institute</a> (IvI), the <a href="https://ibed.uva.nl">Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics</a> (IBED) and the <a href="https://sils.uva.nl">Swammerdam Insitute for Life Sciences</a> (SILS). The AI4Sustainability RPA extends the FNWI <a href="https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io">AI4Science</a> initiative, adopting its style of bringing together experts from different FNWI institutes and creating a laboratory in which scientists work on a AI-based solutions for scientific questions, but with a clear focus on molecules, materials, and sustainability.</p>

<p>In this first call, four 2-year PD projects will be funded as part of the RPA AI4Sustainability mission. These projects will give shape to the AI4Sustainability research aims and will function as the initial core of a growing consortium of supervisers, researchers, students, as wel as external academic and industrial partners interested in employing AI for sustainability. The proposed research must fit with the multidiscplinary AI4Sustainability aims, bridging between AI research (including machine learning, data science, simulation-based inference, surrogate modeling) and scientific reseach related to making and using sustainable materials and molecules (related e.g. to biodegradable plastics, materials and processes for CO2 storage or utilization, non-fossil fuels, enzymatic catalysts, polution and toxicity in natural habitats, etc.), as described in the <a href="https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/ai4susmm_rpa">AI4Sustainability mission</a>.</p>

<p>These projects must involve at least two different supervisors from at least two of the abovementioned involved institutes, who must first submit a pre-proposal (topic and half a page of description) by September 30th. The board of AI4Sustainability will select which pre-proposals are to be developed into full proposals to be delivered by November 15th (details about full proposals to follow later). If you are interested in submitting a project proposal, please send it in PDF format to program coordinator Marcel Bartels (M.J.Bartels@uva.nl) indicating the name of PD supervisors and affiliated institutes in the PDF.</p>
