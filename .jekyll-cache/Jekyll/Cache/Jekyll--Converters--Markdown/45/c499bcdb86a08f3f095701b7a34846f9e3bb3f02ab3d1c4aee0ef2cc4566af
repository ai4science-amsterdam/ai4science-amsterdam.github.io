<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br /></p>

<p>Understanding the selection biases introduced by AI models in scientific analysis and extracting well-calibrated uncertainties on machine learning outputs are two key challenges facing the systematic use of such algorithms in radio astronomy. I this talk I will discuss our recent work on uncertainty calibration for radio galaxy classification including how the use of group-equivariant convolutions can correct effects of bias in model outputs, as well as how data curation in astronomy catalogues can cause likelihood misspecification in Bayesian deep-learning. I will go on to talk about how the effect of data curation can also affect the use of semi-supervised learning that leverages large unlabelled datasets - highly relevant for radio astronomy applications where the volume of labelled catalogue data is small, but the quantity of archival survey data is large.</p>
