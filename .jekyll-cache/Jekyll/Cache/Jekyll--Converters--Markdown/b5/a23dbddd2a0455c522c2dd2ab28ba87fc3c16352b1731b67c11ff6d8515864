<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br /></p>

<p>Combinatorial problems arising in puzzles, origami, and (meta)material design have rare sets of
solutions, which define complex and sharply delineated boundaries in configuration space. These
boundaries are difficult to capture with conventional statistical and numerical methods. Here we
show that convolutional neural networks can learn to recognize these boundaries, down to finest de-
tail, despite using heavily undersampled training sets, and can successfully generalize. This suggests
that the network infers the underlying combinatorial rules from the sparse training set, opening up
new possibilities for complex design of (meta)materials.</p>
