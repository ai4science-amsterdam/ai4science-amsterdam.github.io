I"–<p>From scaling laws to emergent capabilities, modern AI systems, in
particular large language models, display various behaviours that
nobody understands. Statistical mechanics in physics offers a leading
tool to analyse and explain these observed phenomena, and thereby
answering some of the extremely crucial questions in modern AI theory.

student will review the basics of the commonly used methods, delve
into the modern literature, and together with the advisor agree on a
particular problem to tackle, analyse the problem theoretically, and
run small experiments.</p>
