I"‰<p>Plastics are ubiquitous in every part of our society. However, only 9% of used plastics are recycled, which creates an unsustainable rest-stream of plastic waste, which is currently incinerated or landfilled. The Catalysis Engineering group at HIMS is developing a chemical hydrothermal liquefaction process that can transform complex waste streams into useful resources, such as chemicals, materials, nutrients and energy. However, a difficulty is the lack of predictability of the reaction output in terms of yield, composition and by-product formation because of the complex reaction network and the many input parameters involved, including waste composition, reactor temperature, pressure, and catalyst materials present.</p>

<p>In this master project, you will develop a novel AI-based strategy aimed at modeling and guiding the hydrothermal liquefaction process. First, using a diverse set of initial experimental data, you will construct a machine learning-based simulator. Then, introducing an AI-guiding framework based on active learning and Bayesian optimization cycles, you will use and improve the simulator to guide future experiments.</p>
