I"ö<p>Synthesizing molecules and doing experimental analyses can take weeks or even months of labor-intensive research. Generative AI offers a unique opportunity to speed up this process. By efficiently proposing candidate molecules, Generative AI could help experimentalists narrow down the chemical search space significantlyâ€”saving countless work-hours.</p>

<p>In the current state of the art, most approaches use either a Diffusion/Flow-based model on a graph-based representation or frameworks based on LLMs, for a token-based representation of molecules (SMILES). These approaches are demonstrably effective, but are very dissimilar from the <em>chemical intuition</em> used by chemists in the same molecular design process. As such, these methods can seem like a black box, which hinders the furtherance of GenAI in this context.</p>

<p>The <em>AlphaMol</em> project seeks to address this issue by using a completely different approach to navigating the vast chemical space. Motivated by the success of AlphaZero &amp; Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in Reinforcement Learning problems, you will design and develop a Reinforcement Learning agent, similar to AlphaZero, on a new domain: molecule generation. In the process, you will create your own algorithm for effectively navigating the chemical space, by autoregressively â€˜growingâ€™ a molecule from scratch. This method is more interpretable than the â€˜black boxâ€™ methods and is much more similar to the thought process of a chemist when designing new molecules.</p>
