I"»<p>In this project, we will perform an analysis of certain types of
equivalence relations on the space of three-dimensional (3d) Quantum
Field Theories (QFTs) in search of hidden structures and features that
organize this space and help classify 3d QFTs. Specifically, we will
study the infinite web of dualities that can be constructed from a
simple set of path integral operations in certain 3d QFTs, which can
be mnemonically realized as graph operations. The graph representation
of the data that defines the kinematical structure of these 3d QFTs,
and the realization of dualities therein as graph operations,
naturally opens the door to their study by use of Machine Learning
(ML) techniques, namely Graph Neural Networks (GNN). In short, this
project will focus primarily on the use of GNNs, and other concepts in
ML broadly defined, as the methodological basis for a novel study of
dualities in 3d QFTs.  See the

works using machine learning to study somewhat similar problems.</p>
