<p>Causal discovery to reveal complex gene regulation networks from vast
transcriptome datasets Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) model the
biological interactions between genes and provide a better
understanding of the cellular processes and regulation
pathways. Correctly constructed GRNs can play a fundamental role in
solving various biological and biomedical problems, such as tracking
disease development. Technological advances of high-throughput
molecular biology have opened a new research frontier for inferring
GRNs in a completely data-driven way. The great amount of gene
expression data available on the GEO database suggests using AI-based
techniques for processing and modeling such networks. In this project,
we focus on Bacillus subtilis, a well-studied Gram-positive bacterium
with more than 3,000 publicly available transcriptome
datasets. Combining these datasets alongside with reconstructing the
known GRNs can be a very challenging task due to the (un)observable
batch effects in the data that result from the varying data generating
process across experiments. By tackling these issues and applying
novel causal discovery techniques we aim for a better interpretation
of the genes functions and their organization in hierarchical
structures or even revealing unknown regulatory networks.</p>
