<p>Below follows a listing of available research projects for Bachelor or Master students
with an interest in AI for Sustainable Molecules and Materials, and with
a background in a relevant discipline, such as AI, Computational Science, Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Astrophysics, etc. UvA and VU students interested in such a project are 
invited to contact one of the supervising faculty. Experience with machine learning and 
programming is recommended.</p>

<p>Supervisors and group leaders with a student project relevant for the mission of AI4SMM 
can have their project description posted here by sending an email request to Bernd Ensing.</p>

<p>Plastics are ubiquitous in every part of our society. However, only 9%
of used plastics are recycled, which creates an unsustainable
rest-stream of plastic waste, which is currently incinerated or
landfilled. The Catalysis Engineering group at HIMS is developing a
chemical hydrothermal liquefaction process that can transform complex
waste streams into useful resources, such as chemicals, materials,
nutrients and energy. However, a difficulty is the lack of predictability of
the reaction output in terms of yield, composition and by-product
formation because of the complex reaction network and the many input
parameters involved, including waste composition, reactor temperature,
pressure, and catalyst materials present.</p>

<p>In this master project, you will develop a novel AI-based strategy
aimed at modeling and guiding the hydrothermal liquefaction
process. First, using a diverse set of initial experimental data, you
will construct a machine learning-based simulator. Then,
introducing an AI-guiding framework based on active learning and
Bayesian optimization cycles, you will use and improve the simulator to
guide future experiments.</p>
