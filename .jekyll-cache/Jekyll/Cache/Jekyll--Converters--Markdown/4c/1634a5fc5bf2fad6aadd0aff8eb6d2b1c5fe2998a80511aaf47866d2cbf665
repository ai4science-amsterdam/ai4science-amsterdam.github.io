I"Y<p>The FNWI Research Priority Area “<em>Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Molecules and Materials” (AI4Sustainability)</em> has opened a call for  pre-proposals to fund four interdisciplinary 2-year postdoctoral fellow projects. Applications are to be submitted by potential PD supervisors.</p>

<p>The AI4Sustainability RPA is focused on connecting and advancing two research areas that are already core strengths at the UvA Faculty of Science and will, in combination, have an important societal impact: (1) development and application of artifical intelligence and deep learning for data analysis and pattern recognition and (2)  design and utilisation of more sustainable molecules and materials for the transition to a circular economy. AI4Sustainability is formed by researchers from the FNWI institutes the <a href="https://hims.uva.nl">Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences</a> (HIMS), the <a href="https://ivi.uva.nl">Institute of Physics</a> (IoP), the <a href="https://iop.uva.nl">Informatics Institute</a> (IvI), the <a href="https://ibed.uva.nl">Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics</a> (IBED) and the <a href="https://sils.uva.nl">Swammerdam Insitute for Life Sciences</a> (SILS).</p>

<p>In this first call, four 2-year PD projects will be funded as part of the RPA AI4Sustainability mission. These projects will give shape to the AI4Sustainability research aims and will function as the initial core of a growing consortium of supervisers, researchers, students, as wel as external academic and industrial partners interested in employing AI for sustainability. The proposed research must fit with the multidiscplinary AI4Sustainability aims, bridging between AI research (including machine learning, data science, simulation-based inference, surrogate modeling) and scientific reseach related to making and using sustainable materials and molecules (related e.g. to biodegradable plastics, materials and processes for CO2 storage or utilization, non-fossil fuels, enzymatic catalysts, polution and toxicity in natural habitats, etc.), as described in the <a href="https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/ai4susmm_rpa">AI4Sustainability mission</a>.</p>

<p>Two interdisciplinary PhD projects will be funded in the context of FAEME. These projects will play a crucial role in the development of FAEME research directions and as such requires commitment from the supervisors to be active participants in FAEME activities (e.g. Emergence Seminars, workshops, etc) and contribute to a lively research environment. The topic of PhD projects must be aligned with the Core Problem of Emergence, potentially also connecting with existing research efforts at DIEP@UvA (see also DIEP Fellows), AI4Science Lab, and AMCOOL; see also the Project Hub for inspiration. Areas of interest include (quantum) information theory, non-equilibrium statistical physics, theory of critical phenomena, experiments on (quantum) systems and living systems, reaction networks, chemical ecology, multiscale modelling, machine learning, complex system theory, agent-based modelling, causal inference, evolutionary game theory, network analysis and stochastic methods.</p>

<p>These projects must involve at least two different supervisors from at least two of the different institutes involved in FAEME, who must first submit a pre-proposal (topic and 5 lines description) by July 15th. The board of FAEME will select which pre-proposals are to be developed into full proposals to be delivered by October 10th (details about full proposals to follow later). If you are interested in submitting a project proposal, feel free to send it in PDF format to info@d-iep.org indicating the name of PhD supervisors and affiliated institutes in the PDF.</p>
