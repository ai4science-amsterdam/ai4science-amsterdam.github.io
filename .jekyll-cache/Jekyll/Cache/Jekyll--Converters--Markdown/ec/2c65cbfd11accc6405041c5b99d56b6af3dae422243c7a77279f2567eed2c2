<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br /></p>

<p>Science and industry make extensive use of simulations to model the world. However,
conventional statistical inference is often inapplicable to detailed simulation models because their
associated likelihood functions are intractable. In this talk, I discuss how simulation-based
inference (SBI) addresses this problem, with an emphasis on applications to biophysical models
of neural dynamics. I highlight SBIâ€™s potential to close the gap between data-driven and theory-
driven models in neuroscience. Furthermore, I present our recently-introduced, first-ever
benchmark of SBI that compares algorithms in a transparent and reproducible way, explaining
different approaches, metrics for principled comparisons, key findings, and open challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong>  <br />
Jan-Matthis LÃ¼ckmann is currently finishing his PhD in Computer Science at the University of
TÃ¼bingen, advised by Prof. Jakob Macke. Jan-Matthisâ€™ research interests are at the intersection of
machine learning and computational neuroscience. His expertise lies in simulation-based
inference and its applications to mechanistic models. Jan-Matthisâ€™ work includes the proposal of
fast and flexible inference algorithms based on neural density estimation and their applications to
biophysical models in neuroscience. Most recently, he introduced the first-ever benchmark for the
rapidly developing field of simulation-based inference.</p>
