<p>The AI4Science Lab Meetings are a bi-weekly series of research and
literature presentations, held on alternating Thursdays at 11:00 hr,
starting this academic year on 11 September. All members take a turn
to present their work or a thought-provoking paper. The meetings take
place at Science Park and are not online. If you wish to take part in our
Lab Meetings, send <a href="/contact/">an email to us</a> with your name, affiliation and
a one-sentence motivation for joining.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract:</h4>
<p>A new computational task has been defined and solved over the past 15
years for extended material systems: the analytic fitting of the
Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface as a function of nuclear
coordinates. The resulting potentials  (‚Äúforce fields‚Äù) are reactive,
many-body, with evaluation costs that are currently on the order
of 0.1-10 ms/atom/cpu core (or about 1-10ms on a powerful GPU), and
reach accuracies of a few meV/atom when trained specifically for a
given system using iterative or active learning methods. The latest
and most successful architectures leverage many-body symmetric
descriptions of local geometry and equivariant message passing
networks.  Perhaps the most surprising recent result is the stability
of models trained on very diverse training sets across the whole
periodic table. Our recent discovery is that the MACE-MP-0 model that
was trained on just ~150,000 real and hypothetical small inorganic
crystals (90% of training set &lt; 70 atoms), is capable of stable
molecular dynamics at ambient conditions on any system tested so far -
this includes crystals, liquids, surfaces, clusters, molecules, and
combinations of all of these. The astounding generalisation
performance of such foundation models open the possibility to creating
a universally applicable interatomic potential with useful accuracy
for materials (especially when fine-tuned with a little bit of
domain-specific data), and democratise quantum-accurate large scale
molecular simulations by lowering the barrier to entry into the
field. Similarly, in the domain of organic chemistry, training just on
small molecules and small clusters allows accurate simulation of
condensed phase systems, and first principles prediction of quantities
such as hydration free energies for the first time.</p>

<p>G√°bor Cs√°nyi is a Hungarian-born scientist at the University of Cambridge. He read mathematics in Cambridge as an undergraduate at St. John‚Äôs College and did his PhD work in physics at MIT. After postdoctoral research in the Cavendish Laboratory, he joined the faculty in the Department of Engineering at Cambridge. He won an F. W. Bessel award from the Alexander von Humboldt foundation.</p>

<p>His work is in the field of computational chemistry, and is focused on
developing algorithms to predict the properties of materials and
molecules from first principles. He pioneered the application of
machine learning to molecular modeling which lead to enormous gains in
the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulation.</p>
