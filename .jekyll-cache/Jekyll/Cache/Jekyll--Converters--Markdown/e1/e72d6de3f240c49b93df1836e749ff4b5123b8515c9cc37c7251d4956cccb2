<h1 id="ai4science-consortium">AI4Science Consortium</h1>

<p>The AI4Science Lab is the center of a rapidly growing multidisciplinary 
consortium of students, researchers, and experts interested in the 
development and application of artificial intelligence tools for the 
analysis of scientific data. We keep each other informed about interesting 
challenges and new developments. Our activities include organising
<a href="/events/">seminars and workshops</a>, a <a href="/colloquium/">bi-weekly colloquium series</a> and
helping each other with acquiring funding for AI4Science 
spin-offs. Interested in joining the AI4Science consortium?</p>
