<p>The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium, we invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. During the time of the covid-19 pandemic, the AI4Science colloquia were done online via zoom video conferencing. From 2023 on, the colloquia will be held onsite again, at the UvA Science Park LAB42 building.
