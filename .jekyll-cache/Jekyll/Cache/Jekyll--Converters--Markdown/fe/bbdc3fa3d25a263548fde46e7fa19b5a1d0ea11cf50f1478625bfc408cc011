<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
Cell Biology revolves around the idea that cells are core functional units of organisms: Models for cellular function explain many disease and treatment effects, for example. Hence, there has been a long-standing, significant interest in improving the understanding of cellular behaviour. Recent experimental advances enable increasingly detailed molecular profiling of cells: Examples include methods such as single-cell RNA sequencing, which measure quantities of particular molecular species in each cell. The resulting output can be summarised as a matrix (cells x molecular features) with up to millions of cells and 10,000s of features. Models for variance in these data sets are actively developed in Computational Biology; many concepts from unsupervised learning are used in this context. While these unsupervised techniques yield useful descriptions of the molecular state space, they usually fail to yield a complete picture of molecular mechanisms of causality underlying this variance. Here, I discuss approaches centred on supervision tasks in single-cell Immunology which improve interpretability of these models and outline ways of generalising this approach to other settings in single-cell Biology. Lastly, I discuss challenges and opportunities of representation learning on whole tissues, bridging the gap from cell-centric models to tissue function models, such as for tumor behaviour.</p>

<p>Date: 29-09-2020 14:00-15:00 Central European Summer Time</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
Optical images of galaxy-galaxy lensing systems carry information about the small scale structure of dark matter. Although the underlying physics is simple, the large uncertainties regarding the surface brightness of the source galaxy as well as the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy make these images notoriously difficult to model and to analyse. In order to tackle this difficult task, we developed a new analysis pipeline that makes use of a whole arsenal of modern machine learning techniques: variational inference, probabilistic programming, Gaussian processes, and neural likelihood-to-ratio estimation. I will present the current state of our work, discuss remaining challenges, as well as opportunities for similar astronomical image analysis problems.</p>
