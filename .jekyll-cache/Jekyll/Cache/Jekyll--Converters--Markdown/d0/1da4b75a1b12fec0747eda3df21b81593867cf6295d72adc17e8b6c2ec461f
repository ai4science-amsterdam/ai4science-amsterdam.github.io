<p>Speaker: <strong>Rajesh Ranganath</strong>, NYU</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br /></p>

<p>Interpretability enriches what can be gleaned from a good predictive
model. Techniques that learn-to-explain have arisen because they
require only a single evaluation of a model to provide an
interpretation. In the first part of this talk, I will discuss a flaw
with several methods that learn-to-explain: the optimal explainer
makes the prediction rather than highlighting the inputs that are
useful for prediction. I will also describe an evaluation technique
that can detect when the explainer makes the prediction along with a
new method that learns-to-explain without this issue.
In the second part of my talk, I will discuss our work on
representation learning for out of distribution generalization. I will
construct a family of representations that generalize when under
changing  nuisance-induced spurious correlations and have applications
to images and chest X-rays. I will show how nuisance variables can be
constructed using limited prior knowledge and augmentations of the input.</p>
