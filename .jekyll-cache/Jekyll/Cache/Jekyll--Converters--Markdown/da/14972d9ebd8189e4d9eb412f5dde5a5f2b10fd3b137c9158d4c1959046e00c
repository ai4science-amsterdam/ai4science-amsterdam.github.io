<p>PhD research of <strong>Jacobus Dijkman</strong></p>

<p>Although less famous than the quantum version used for electronic
structure calculations, classical density functional theory (cDFT)
remains a very appealing approach to describe fluids. However, similar
as in quantum DFT, the accuracy of the theory is hampered by the lack
of an exact description of the (free) energy functional. Over the
years, various approximations have been developed, albeit with mixed
success.</p>

<p>Now, with a team of researchers at the Computational Chemistry Group (Van
‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences) and the AMLab (Informatics
Institute), together with the Debye
Institute for Nanomaterials Science and the Institute for Theoretical
Physics of Utrecht University, we have developed a machine-learned approximation
that can significantly improve cDFT calculations of fluids and
vapours.</p>

<p>Our ‘neural density functional’ can be trained in two manners. The
first approach applies the first functional derivative of the free
energy, which requires for training a large dataset of inhomogeneous
particle densities on a 3D grid computed with Monte Carlo simulations
under various external potentials. This is computationally rather
demanding. The second approach, based on the second functional
derivatives, requires a dataset of only 1D radial distribution
functions of only homogeneous densities. This requires significantly
fewer simulations.</p>

<p>Remarkably, we were able to show that the second approach
works as well as the first for a simple Lennard-Jones liquid in a 1D
planar symmetry. Work is underway to apply the new method to more
practical applications.</p>
