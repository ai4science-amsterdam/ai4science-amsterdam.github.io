<p>PhD research of <strong>David Ruhe</strong></p>

<p>One of the cutting edge areas of astronomy is recognising rare
features in data streams in near-real time. This problem has arisen
from massive imaging surveys of the sky at many wavelengths (optical,
radio, X-ray). The purpose is no longer just to find objects that are
there all or most of the time, but to find so-called â€˜transientâ€™
objects that appear fleetingly in hindsight.</p>

<p>These transients are typically multi-messenger events, meaning that
their emission is seen throughout the electromagnetic spectrum and
using other â€˜messengersâ€™ including neutrinos and gravitational
waves. By combining the multi-messenger observations, we can probe the
most extreme physical environments in the universe. However, we are
not monitoring the whole sky all the time with sensitive
observatories, so we need to alert them to interesting objects in
order to trigger follow-up observations. As these events are often
fleeting at different wavelengths, we need to trigger the follow-up in
as close to real-time as possible.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of our searches, we cannot always predict the
transient behaviour we are searching for, nor all more rare specific
instrumental faults in the data stream. The real-time data streams are
subject to different types of behaviour, which we do not want to
confuse with astrophysical transient events, including radio frequency
interference, calibration artefacts, varying noise features, space
weather, meteors, airplanes and satellites.</p>

<p>There are multiple areas where ML can assist with solving the task at
hand and the challenges it comes with. Examples are: finding latent
(disentangled) representations of observed phenomena, undoing data
corruption (e.g. denoising), unsupervised outlier detection, geometric
deep learning. The project will explore the application and innovation
of these techniques and will push the boundaries of machine learning
and astronomy.</p>
