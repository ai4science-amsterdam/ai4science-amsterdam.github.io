<p>Plastics are ubiquitous in every part of our society. However, only 9%
of used plastics are recycled, which creates an unsustainable
rest-stream of plastic waste, which is currently incinerated or
landfilled. The Catalysis Engineering group at HIMS is developing a
chemical hydrothermal liquefaction process that can transform complex
waste streams into useful resources, such as chemicals, materials,
nutrients and energy. However, a difficulty is the lack of predictability of
the reaction output in terms of yield, composition and by-product
formation because of the complex reaction network and the many input
parameters involved, including waste composition, reactor temperature,
pressure, and catalyst materials present.</p>

<p>In this master project, you will develop a novel AI-based strategy
aimed at modeling and guiding the hydrothermal liquefaction
process. First, using a diverse set of initial experimental data, you
will construct a machine learning-based simulator. Then,
introducing an AI-guiding framework based on active learning and
Bayesian optimization cycles, you will use and improve the simulator to
guide future experiments.</p>
