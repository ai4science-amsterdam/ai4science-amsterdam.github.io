<h4 id="from-atoms-to-accelerated-discovery-machine-learning-pathways-for-catalysis-and-materials-innovation">From Atoms to Accelerated Discovery: Machine Learning Pathways for Catalysis and Materials Innovation</h4>
<p>by Dr. Nong Artrith <br />
<em>Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands</em></p>

<p>The search for efficient, earth-abundant catalysts and functional materials is central to achieving a
sustainable energy future. My research explores how machine learning (ML), integrated with atomistic
simulations, enables faster, deeper, and more scalable materials discovery.
Can ML answer the fundamental question: What makes a catalyst good? ML offers a shortcut through
complex chemical space by bypassing expensive first-principles calculations. From neural networks
that learn interatomic interactions to models that recognize patterns in catalytic activity, ML has become
an essential tool in computational chemistry.
However, ML needs data, and experimental datasets are often small and inconsistent. To address this,
we developed a hybrid approach that combines a machine-learned transition-state energy library with
simple regression models trained on experimental data. Applied to ethanol reforming, this method not
only explains observed trends but also proposes new, testable bimetallic catalysts.
Scaling this strategy requires efficient ML infrastructure. Our √¶net-PyTorch platform enables GPU-
accelerated training of neural network potentials, significantly reducing computational cost. Because
data efficiency remains critical, we apply transfer learning from large open databases such as OC20 to
improve model generalization, enabling accurate simulations even with limited system-specific data.
For interfacial reactions such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we use ML-trained potentials to
perform long-timescale metadynamics on Ni-doped BaTiO‚ÇÉ, revealing mechanistic insights beyond the
reach of standard DFT.</p>

<p>BIOGRAPHY<br />
Nong Artrith is a tenured Assistant Professor in the Materials Chemistry and
Catalysis Group at the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht
University, (and was a Visiting Researcher at Microsoft Research
Amsterdam Lab in 2022-2023). Prior to joining Utrecht University, Nong
was a Research Scientist at Columbia University, USA, and a PI in the
Columbia Center for Computational Electrochemistry. Nong obtained her
PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, for
the development of machine-learning (ML) models for materials chemistry.
She was awarded a Schlumberger Foundation fellowship for postdoctoral
research at MIT and subsequently joined UC Berkeley as an associate
specialist. In 2019, Nong has been named a Scialog Fellow for Advanced
Energy Storage. Since 2023, Nong is a member of the NL ARC CBBC
(https://arc-cbbc.nl ). She is the main developer of the open-source ML
package √¶net (http://ann.atomistic.net ) for atomistic simulations. Her
research interests focus on the development and application of first principles
and ML methods for the computational discovery of energy materials and for
the interpretation of experimental observations.</p>
