I"¬<p>Aviation accounts for approximately 2.5% of human-made global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions, and the road towards fully electrification of airplane
transport seems particularly long. A significant intermediate step towards our
aim to avoid fosil fuels would be to use synthetic jet fuels produced
from more sustainable sources.</p>

<p>In the Computational Chemistry, we combine quantum chemical
simulations with machine learning and generative AI models, such as
language models and denoising diffusion models, to help with the
design of improved materials and molecules. In this master project, we
will focus on improving the chemical process of synthetic jet fuel
production, which starts from conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to
methanol, which is then further converted into longer olefin
molecules, and finally into synthetic kerosine. In particular, you
will further develop, condition, and apply a molecular diffusion model
to generate catalyst materials for olefin polymerisation with improved
yield and selectivity, using data from quantum chemical calculations.</p>

NERA, a startup company focused on developing sustainable
aviation fuel, and researchers from the TU Delft and TU
