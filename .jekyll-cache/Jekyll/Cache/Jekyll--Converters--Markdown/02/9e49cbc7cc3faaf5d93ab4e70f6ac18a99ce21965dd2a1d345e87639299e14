<center> <h2>How can we detect, classify, and predict relevant patterns in scientific data if they are hidden within large amount of non-relevant data?</h2> </center>

<p>The AI4Science Laboratory is an initiative supported by the Faculty of Exact Sciences (FNWI) at the University of Amsterdam and located in the Informatics Institute (IvI). The AI4Science Lab is also connected to AMLAB, the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab.</p>

<p>We develop and use machine learning techniques to discover patterns in data streams produced by experiments in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from ecology to molecular biology and from chemistry to astrophysics.</p>
