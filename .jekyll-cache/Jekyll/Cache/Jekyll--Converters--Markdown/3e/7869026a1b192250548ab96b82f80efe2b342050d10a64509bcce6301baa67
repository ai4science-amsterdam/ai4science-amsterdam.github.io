<p>PhD research of <strong>Fiona Lippert</strong></p>

<p>Every year millions of birds travel hundreds if not thousands of
kilometers between their breeding and wintering grounds, seeking for
seasonally optimal habitats. These mass movements are an essential
component of biodiversity as they link otherwise separated
ecosystems. Climate change and rapid expansions of human structures
and activities may have severe implications for migrating birds. In
order to assess the ecological consequences of these developments and
to devise measures to preserve migration systems, it is essential to
better understand continental-scale migration patterns and its
external drivers such as weather, habitat quality and land use.</p>

<p>However, studying the aerial movement of migrating birds on a large
scale is challenging. Many birds migrate during the night or at high
altitudes which makes it impossible for humans to observe them from
the ground. Modern tracking devices overcome this issue but they are
limited to very few individuals and species with sufficient body
mass. Radar technology is considered a promising alternative. In
particular international networks of weather radars, which are known
to capture mass movements of migrating birds, offer unparalleled
opportunities to quantify and analyze bird migration at large spatial
and temporal scales. But the field of radar aeroecology is still in
its infancy. Challenges relating to the mere volume of raw radar
observations as well as data quality issues such as inconsistent
calibration and preprocessing, observation artifacts and partial
observability prevent ecologists from utilizing the full potential of
available radar databases.</p>

<p>This project will explore the use of machine learning to overcome this
hurdle. By applying and advancing techniques for system identification
and predictive modeling of partially observed spatio-temporal
dynamical systems we aim at enhancing both the understanding and
predictability of continental-scale bird migration in Europe.</p>
