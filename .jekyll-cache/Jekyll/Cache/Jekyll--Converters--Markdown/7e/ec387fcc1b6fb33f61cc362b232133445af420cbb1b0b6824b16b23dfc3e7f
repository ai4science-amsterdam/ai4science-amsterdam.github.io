<p>PhD research of <strong>Jim Boelrijk</strong></p>

<p>Two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) is a powerful technique
to separate and detect trace molecular compounds in complex samples
(think of proteins, antibodies, oils, paints, etc.). The separation is
based on the difference in ‚Äúretention‚Äù time that it takes for each
compound to be carried by a solvent (mobile phase) through a column
filled with a material (stationary phase) that interacts with the
injected compounds based on a chosen property, such as molecular size,
charge or hydrophilicity, as schematically drawn on the right. 2DLC is
combined with a detection method such as UV-VIS, IR, or mass
spectroscopy (MS), that identifies the separated molecules. As the
compounds can have extremely low concentrations (e.g. protein
biomarkers, plant hormones, food contaminants), the signals of
interest are often buried in the noise of the data and information is
being lost. Typical datasets contain several gigabytes of data per
measurement.</p>

<p>Analyzing and extracting all relevant information from such data is a
challenging task. In addition, 2DLC method development is daunting as
there are numerous parameters one can vary in order to achieve optimal
separation. Successful implementation of the technique requires months
of costly and cumbersome development. In response to this, algorithms
are being developed to model chromatographic interaction of analyte
molecules with the chemical moieties of the stationary phase, so as to
allow prediction of optimal chromatographic conditions. In this
project, we will look at the application of AI techniques, such as
Bayesian inference, Bayesian optimization and deep learning to tackle
parameter optimization, peak detection, baseline correction, and
more.</p>
