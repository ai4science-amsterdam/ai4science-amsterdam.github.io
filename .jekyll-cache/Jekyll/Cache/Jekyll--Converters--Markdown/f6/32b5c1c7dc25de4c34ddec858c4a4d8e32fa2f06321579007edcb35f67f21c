<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
E(3) is the Euclidean group in dimension 3. That is the group of rotations, translations, and mirror. e3nn is a pytorch library that aims to create E(3) equivariant neural networks. The focus is on point clouds and recent applications have been in the realm of interatomic potential learning, phonon density of states, and to relevant benchmarks.</p>
