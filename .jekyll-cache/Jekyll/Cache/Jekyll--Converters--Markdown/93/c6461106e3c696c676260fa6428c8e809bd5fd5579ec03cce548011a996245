<center> <h1>AI4Science Laboratorium</h1> </center>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can we detect, classify, and predict relevant patterns in scientific data if they are hidden within large amount of non-relevant data?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AI4Science Laboratory is an initiative supported by the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-of-science.html">Faculty of Exact Sciences (FNWI)</a> at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a> and located in the <a href="https://ivi.uva.nl">Informatics Institute (IvI)</a>. The AI4Science Lab is also connected to <a href="http://amlab.science.uva.nl">AMLAB</a>, the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab.</p>

<p>We develop and use machine learning techniques to discover patterns in data streams produced by experiments in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from ecology to molecular biology and from chemistry to astrophysics.</p>

      <p>The breakthrough discovery of the first gravitational wave
      signal in September 2015 (Nobel Prize 2017) has opened a new
      window to the Universe. Analyses of the signal waveforms during
      the initial inspiral, merger and final ringdown phase provide
      crucial information about the properties of superheavy stellar objects.</p>

      <p>An active field of research in astronomy deals with recognising
      rare features in data streams from space obervations in
      (almost) real time. This challenging task arises from the
      massive imaging surveys of the sky carried our at a wide range
      of wavelengths (optical, radio, X-ray). The purpose is no longer
      just to find objects that are there all or most of the time, but
      also to spot so-called ‘transient’ objects that appear only fleetingly.</p>

      <p>
      Two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) is a powerful
      technique to separate and detect trace molecular compounds in
      complex samples such as food contaminants, industrial production
      streams, urine, or blood, to name but a few examples. However,
      successful implementation requires time-consuming experiment-specific
      optimization of many parameters. Machine learning can aid
      with data-analysis and the acceleration of optimization.
