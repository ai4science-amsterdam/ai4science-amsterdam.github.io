I"Œ<p>High-energy collisions at the LHC and its High-Luminosity upgrade
     (HL-LHC) produce a large number of particles along the beam
     collision axis, outside of the acceptance of existing
     experiments. The FASER experiment has in 2023, for the first
     time, detected neutrinos produced in LHC collisions, and is now
     starting to elucidate their properties. FASER data has the
     potential to improve our understanding of the strong interactions
     as well as of proton and nuclear structure, providing access to
     both the very low-x and the very high-x regions of the colliding
     protons. The former regime is sensitive to novel QCD production
     mechanisms, such as BFKL effects and non-linear dynamics, as well
     as the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) down to very
     small Bjorken-x values, well beyond the coverage of other
     experiments and providing key inputs for astroparticle
     physics. In addition, FASER acts as a neutrino-induced
     deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiment with TeV-scale
     neutrino beams. The resulting measurements of neutrino DIS
     structure functions represent a valuable handle on the partonic
     structure of nucleons and nuclei, particularly their quark
     flavour separation, that is fully complementary to the
     charged-lepton DIS measurements expected at the upcoming
     Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). In this project, the student will
     carry out updated simulations of neutrino scattering and
     detection at FASER, assess the precision with which neutrino
     cross-sections will be measured, develop novel monte carlo event
     generation tools for high-energy neutrino scattering, and
     quantify their impact on proton and nuclear structure by means of
     <strong>machine learning tools within the NNPDF framework</strong> and
     state-of-the-art calculations in perturbative Quantum
     Chromodynamics. Specifically, we aim to determine whether FASER
     data can detect intrinsic charm in the proton and whether FASER
     can find evidence for BFKL small-x QCD dynamics, complementing
     studies provided by other experiments such as the LHC detectors.</p>
