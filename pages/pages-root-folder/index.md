> How can we detect, classify, and predict relevant patterns in scientific data if they are hidden within large amount of non-relevant data?


Amsterdam AI for Science (AA4S) is a research center in the [Faculty of Science (FNWI)][2] of the [University of Amsterdam][3], connecting researchers and students from informatics, maths, ecology, chemistry, physics, biology, and astrophysics. Our mission is to initiate and advance developments in machine learning for scientific research. The AI4Science Laboratory is located in the [Informatics Institute (IvI)][4], next to the [AMLab][5] in the [LAB42 Buidling][8] at Amsterdam Science Park. [Read more here][9].

# About Amsterdam AI4Science


The AI4Science Lab is an initiative supported by the [Faculty of Science (FNWI)][2] at the [University of Amsterdam][3] and located in the [Informatics Institute (IvI)][4] in [LAB42][8]. The AI4Science Lab is also connected to [AMLAB][5], the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab.

We develop and use machine learning techniques to discover patterns in data streams produced by experiments in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from ecology to molecular biology and from chemistry to astrophysics.

# AI4Science Consortium


The AI4Science Lab is the center of a rapidly growing multidisciplinary 
consortium of students, researchers, and experts interested in the 
development and application of artificial intelligence tools for the 
analysis of scientific data. We keep each other informed about interesting 
challenges and new developments. Our activities include organising
[seminars and workshops][6], a [bi-weekly colloquium series][7] and
helping each other with acquiring funding for AI4Science 
spin-offs. Interested in joining the AI4Science consortium?
