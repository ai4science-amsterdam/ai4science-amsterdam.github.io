## The AI4Science Colloquium Series

The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium, we invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. During the time of the covid-19 pandemic, the AI4Science colloquia were done online via zoom video conferencing. From 2023 on, the colloquia will be held onsite again, at the UvA Science Park LAB42 building.
To see the colloquium schedule, subscribe to the email announcements, and watch video recordings of previous speakers please [click here][1].

## Workshops and symposia


#### Data Science Day, AI for Science: opportunities and challenges {#DataScienceDay}

Join us for presentations by
- [Prof. dr. Paul Groth][5], scientific director Data Science Centre
- [Dr. Bernd Ensing][6], director FNWI AI4Science Laboratory

followed by a panel discussion with our speakers and
- [Dr. Daniela Huppenkothen][7], staff researcher at SRON Netherlands and Data Science fellow at the University of Washington
- [Prof. Alfons Hoekstra ][8], scientific director of the new FNWI Molecular and Material Design hub

This event delves into the evolving role of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in scientific research, exploring the intersection
of AI with various disciplines, including physics, humanities, social
sciences, mathematics, and biology. Participants will gain insights
into how AI is transforming the scientific process, from uncovering
new research areas to enhancing dissemination of results. The session
will also highlight key challenges such as reproducibility,
transparency, and interpretation, as well as broader ethical and
societal concerns surrounding AI in science. Discussions will cover
the impact of AI on science and the science systems. This event offers
a comprehensive platform for exploring AI’s potential while addressing
the hurdles that come with its integration into scientific practices. 

* When: 18 October 2024, 10.30-12.00 hr
* Where: The Atrium in Lab42, Science Park, Amsterdam

Organised in collaboration with the AI4Science Lab, this event is part
of the [UvA Data Science Day][4]. Throughout the day, you can attend
presentations and workshops on data science and AI at various UvA
campus locations. You can register for this session only, or choose
more sessions that interest you and create your ideal programme!

The AI4Science Kickoff Workshop aims to bring junior and expert
researchers together that share the interest in artificial
intelligence developments for scientific discovery. Several invited
speakers working on the forefronts of combining data science with
e.g. systems biology, particle physics, molecular modeling, and
astrophysics, will talk about intriguing scientific challenges and
their latest developments to tackle them.
We also take this moment to announce and celebrate the completion of this
stage of the AI4Science Laboratory. Five PhD students that started
their research projects in the last months will briefly highlight the
current state-of-the-art and their future perspective on using AI in
their respective scientific domains. 
Virtual workshop hosted by [ELLIS][3].
