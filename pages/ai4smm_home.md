Researchers discover, study, and design molecules and
materials in all FNWI institutes related to chemistry, ecology, physics, 
and biology. The research focus area _Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Molecules and Materials_
(AI4SMM) connects and promotes research focused on making molecules and 
materials for a sustainable planet by leveraging the utility of artificial intelligence.

The multidisciplinary AI4SMM Laboratory bridges the FNWI strengths related to
sustainability, AI, and design of smart materials and molecules. AI4SMM aims to
be a knowledge hub within a green and smart ecosystem that includes the UvA Sustainability
Platform, the AI4Science Lab, AMLab, the Computational Soft Matter Lab, the Computational
Chemistry Group, but also the  MaterialenNL Platform, Port of Amsterdam, and so forth.

The AI4Science Lab and the Amsterdam Chemistry Network are organizing the
ChemAI Symposium on November 16th in LAB42 in Amsterdam.
Please join us! We are looking forward to connect with academic and
industrial partners and explore how we can exploit artificial intelligence
to make chemical processes and materials in a sustainable manner.

* When: 16 November 2023
* Where: LAB42 Room L1.01, Science Park, Amsterdam
