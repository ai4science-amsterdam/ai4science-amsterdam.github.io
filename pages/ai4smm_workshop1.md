Recently, the University of Amsterdam initiated its [Research Priority
Area on AI for Sustainable Molecules and Materials][0]. On Thursday
afternoon, 30 May 2024, a festive kick-off meeting will be organized
for research staff, students and external guests who are working in
this field already, as well as researchers interested in learning
about this new vibrant field of science. Especially for the latter,
the program contains inspiring showcases and matchmaking activities.

### Invitation for active participation 
Via the [registration form][3], participants can indicate whether they would
like to present a poster and/or a 5-minute plenary soundbite (10 slots
available) on a running project or new research idea. All in order to
inspire each other and display the pluriformity of sustainability
research in science that benefits from the enhancement by AI.
