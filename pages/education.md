bachelor1:
  title: "Data Science for Chemistry"
  partof: "Exchange Programme Faculty of Science"
  coordinator: "Saer Samanipour"
  description: "In this course the mathematical basics of several numerical analysis concepts will be explored. A suite of numerical tools, from data pre-processing to multivariate modeling strategies, will be discussed during the lectures. The students will be encouraged to generate their own implementations of the learnt tools in a high-level programming language such as Julia language."
  credits: "6 EC"
  period: "1"

bachelor2:
  title: "AI for Science"
  partof: "College of Sciences"
  coordinator: "Bernd Ensing"
  description: "The course Artificial Intelligence for Science will provide the fundamentals of machine learning methodologies. Rather than a formal exposure, it will consist of a more hands-on approach tailored to students interested in applying machine learning to scientific problems. The course is targeted at a broad audience: from computational scientists who wish to dive in data-driven science, to experimental researchers keen on integrating machine learning in their work."
  credits: "6 EC"
  period: "2"

master1:
  title: "Advanced Chemometrics and Statistics"
  partof: "Master's Chemistry (joint degree)"
  coordinator: "Saer Samanipour"
  description: "In this course the mathematical theory of univariate and multivariate statistics (e.g. PLS-DA, Random Forrest classification, and Hierarchical Clustering) as well as modelling (e.g. PCA and MCR-ALS) and optimization will be discussed."
  credits: "6 EC"
  period: "5"

master2:
  title: "Machine learning for chemistry"
  partof: "Master's Chemistry (joint degree)"
  coordinator: "Bernd Ensing"
  description: "The course Machine Learning for Chemistry will provide a broad understanding of current deep learning methodologies and their application in chemical research. Rather than a formal exposure, it will consist of a more hands-on approach tailored to students interested in applying deep learning to (molecular) scientific problems."
