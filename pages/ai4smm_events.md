#### ChemAI Day

__Entering the fifth paradigm for chemistry!__---this is the title of
the first ChemAI Day, organised this November 16th on our Science Park
Campus in Amsterdam. Of course, AI4SMM will be present at this event
to discuss with anyone interested the ChemAI question: _how AI is
changing chemical discovery_? And our take on this qustion is, not
surprisingly, _how can AI help to do this in a sustainable manner_?
Please join us! We are looking forward to connect with academic and
industrial partners to enlarge our consortium.

* When: 16 November 2023
* Where: LAB42 Room L1.01, Science Park, Amsterdam
