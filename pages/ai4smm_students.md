Plastics are ubiquitous in every part of our society. However, only 9%
of used plastics are recycled, which creates an unsustainable
rest-stream of plastic waste, which is currently incinerated or
landfilled. The Catalysis Engineering group at HIMS is developing a
chemical hydrothermal liquefaction process that can transform complex
waste streams into useful resources, such as chemicals, materials,
nutrients and energy. However, a difficulty is the lack of predictability of
the reaction output in terms of yield, composition and by-product
formation because of the complex reaction network and the many input
parameters involved, including waste composition, reactor temperature,
pressure, and catalyst materials present.

In this master project, you will develop a novel AI-based strategy
aimed at modeling and guiding the hydrothermal liquefaction
process. First, using a diverse set of initial experimental data, you
will construct a machine learning-based simulator. Then,
introducing an AI-guiding framework based on active learning and
Bayesian optimization cycles, you will use and improve the simulator to
guide future experiments.
