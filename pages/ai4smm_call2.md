Previously, the FNWI Research Focus Area "Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Molecules and Materials" (AI4SMM) has granted four kick-off projects that started in the past year as collaborations within different institutes within FNWI. The AI4SMM board has allocated the remaining budget of k€ 1,190 for a single flagship project, to start early 2025. 
 
Currently there are two initiatives known by the board that may qualify for funding as such a flagship project. End November the board will decide to which initiative the funds will be granted. Since the board aims to select from a comprehensive list of eligible initiatives, all scientific staff at FNWI is invited to submit a proposal for a flagship project. The time line is short, so only consortia with already solid commitments who can make a head start are invited to submit.

### Call conditions
 - A proposal must involve at least two applicants from different FNWI institutes. 
 - Each (co-)applicant can only contribute to a single consortium application. 
 - Funds for PhD and/or postdoc positions and other costs can be requested. A proposal should contain the complete budget. 
 - Substantial (≥ 25%) co-funding (in cash or in kind) of external partner(s) is a prerequisite. 
 - Personnel positions granted in this call should be filled ultimately 1 July 2025. 
 - Maximum one flagship project will be funded. 
 - At least one member of the consortium has to participate to the introduction session at 21 October. 
 - The proposed project will be assessed on how it aims to contribute to the AI4SMM mission, and in particular related to: 
    * Sustainability 
    * Molecules/Materials 
    * Artificial Intelligence 
    * Active involvement of non-academic partners.
