The AI4Science Colloquium series for this academic year has come to an end.

The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested? Subscribe to our Email-list to be notified.

## Email List
To stay up to date with our activities and be invited to our biweekly AI4Science colloquium series, you may send a request to be included in our emaillist via [an email to us][9] with your name, affiliation and a one-sentence motivation for joining.

#### Density functional theory and machine learning:  The race to find the next best approximation

Date: Tuesday 11 June 2024 at 11:00-1200 CET <br/>
Place: Science Park 904,  Room A1.28

Speaker: **KieronBurke**, University of California at Irive, USA.

**Abstract:** <br/>

At least 50,000 papers each year report the results of Kohn-Sham density functional calculations for
materials and molecular properties.  This is a huge worldwide effort, growing rapidly with computer
power and powerful machine-learning algorithms to search for desired properties.   But all these
calculations are limited by the accuracy and generality of our current approximations.
I will discuss the race to use machine learning to find the next best approximate functional, and the
potential impact.

**Bio:** <br/>

Professor Kieron Burke in a distinguished professor in the Chemistry
department and the Physics department at UC Irvine. Prof. Burke is
well-known for his fundamental work on Density Functional Theory. The
“B” in the popular “PBE”-functional stands for Burke, so several of us
have probably used this DFT functional that he co-developed. He has
worked extensively on the DFT formalism, extensions to new areas, and
applications in chemistry, materials science, matter under extreme
conditions, and so forth. Recently, he has also focused on errors in
DFT and machine learned density functionals.
