The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested? Subscribe to our Email-list to be notified.

Speaker: **Benjamin Miller**, PhD Student at AMLab and GRAPPA in the AI4Science initiative

**Abstract:** <br/>
Empirical scientific research bounds inferred values of physical constants using posteriors marginalized over nuisance parameters. In a likelihood-based approach, the marginal posterior is usually sampled by marginalizing over samples from the joint posterior. This method suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the necessity of a tractable likelihood function. We introduce a set of algorithms which approximate any marginal posterior of interest directly and efficiently. The basis is neural likelihood-free (simulation-based) inference using likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation. We increase simulator efficiency by constraining the prior using an indicator function. In this way, we learn an amortized estimate of the target posterior. In addition, we propose a method for principled reuse of simulated data based on an inhomogeneous Poisson point process. These algorithms were designed with the practical needs of computational physics in mind. Specifically targeting the regime of slow simulators and narrow target posteriors.
The talk itself will focus on the details of [this paper][4] which introduced these methods. You can find an implementation of the method on [github][3]

## Previous Colloquia

#### Towards Accelerated, Reproducible, Physics-informed AI-driven Discovery

Speaker: **Jakub Tomczak**, Assistant Professor inside Computational Intelligence Group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, former AMLAB member

**Abstract:** <br/>
Life sciences is a fascinating field that tries to answer fundamental questions about ourselves, other species, and interactions within and among various environments. (Bio)chemistry and physics are typical tools to study and comprehend our world. However, due to the high complexity of biological systems, standard tools are not enough to understand and model all underlying relationships. Computational methods could serve as a possible remedy to that.
In this talk, I will show how we can use computational intelligence, Bayesian inference, and deep learning to deal with some problems in life sciences. Specifically, we will discuss how to identify parameters in dynamical models of biological networks, how to find values of kinetic parameters in enzyme kinetics (including COVID-19), and how to count cells automatically.
