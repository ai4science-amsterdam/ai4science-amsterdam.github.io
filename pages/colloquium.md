The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested?

Speaker: **Mario Geiger**, PhD Student, EPFL, Lausanne

**Abstract:** <br/>
E(3) is the Euclidean group in dimension 3. That is the group of rotations, translations, and mirror. e3nn is a pytorch library that aims to create E(3) equivariant neural networks. The focus is on point clouds and recent applications have been in the realm of interatomic potential learning, phonon density of states, and to relevant benchmarks.

## Schedule
-  19 January 2021 - **Dim Coumou**
- 2 February 2021 - **Mario Geiger**
- 16 February 2021 - **Eliu Huerta Escudero**
- 2 March 2021 - **Jakub Tomczak**

## Previous Colloquia

#### Machine Learning in climate science: Finding causal connections and improving seasonal forecasts

Date: 19-01-2021 14:00-15:00 Central European Time

Speaker: **Dim Coumou**, Associate Professor, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

**Abstract:** <br/>
Summer, with most biological and agricultural production, is probably the season when future changes in extremes will have the most-severe impacts on humanity. Summer extremes are particularly devastating when they persist for several days: Many consecutive hot-and-dry days causing harvest failure, or stagnating wet extremes causing flooding. Often such situations are related to quasi-stationary waves in the Jetstream. Despite this importance, we are far from a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in creating such quasi-stationary waves, nor how they will change with future warming.
Using machine learning techniques based on causal inference we can understand and quantify the drivers and causal pathways that influence jet dynamics. I will present several examples of how causal inference techniques can disentangle cause from effect to provide insights into the dynamics of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and teleconnections. Understanding the physical pathways in atmosphere by quantifying causal links can help improving forecasts on seasonal to sub-seasonal timescales including prolonged extremes like heat waves and droughts. Some of these data-driven forecasts using machine learning outperform operational forecasts based on dynamical models. Ultimately we aim for developing hybrid forecast methods to improve early warning of extreme weather events.
