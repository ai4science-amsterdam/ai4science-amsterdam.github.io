The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested? Subscribe to our Email-list to be notified.

Speaker: **Jakub Tomczak**, Assistant Professor inside Computational Intelligence Group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, former AMLAB member

**Abstract:** <br/>
Life sciences is a fascinating field that tries to answer fundamental questions about ourselves, other species, and interactions within and among various environments. (Bio)chemistry and physics are typical tools to study and comprehend our world. However, due to the high complexity of biological systems, standard tools are not enough to understand and model all underlying relationships. Computational methods could serve as a possible remedy to that.
In this talk, I will show how we can use computational intelligence, Bayesian inference, and deep learning to deal with some problems in life sciences. Specifically, we will discuss how to identify parameters in dynamical models of biological networks, how to find values of kinetic parameters in enzyme kinetics (including COVID-19), and how to count cells automatically.

## Schedule
-  19 January 2021 - **Dim Coumou**

## Previous Colloquia

#### Towards Accelerated, Reproducible, Physics-informed AI-driven Discovery

Date: 16-02-2021  15:00-16:00 Central European Time

Speaker: **Eliu Huerta Escudero**, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

**Abstract:** <br/>
In this talk I will describe disruptive advances I have pioneered at the interface of domain-inspired AI and extreme scale computing. I will present exemplars on how to scale disruptive advances in AI, distributed computing, and scientific data infrastructure to open new pathways to conduct reproducible, accelerated, data-driven discovery.

**Bio:** <br/>
Eliu Huerta is a theoretical astrophysicist, mathematician and computer scientist with broad research interests. He has done pioneering work at the interface of domain-inspired AI and extreme scale computing for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, Cosmology, Observational Astronomy, and extreme scale simulations that describe multi-scale and multi-physics processes. He is the founding director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Head of the Gravity Group at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. He leads several NSF- and DOE-funded interdisciplinary and multi-institutional projects that focus on disruptive AI applications and advanced computing for big-data physics experiments.
