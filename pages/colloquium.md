Speaker: **Andrew Ferguson**, Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago

**Abstract:** <br/>

Data-driven modeling and deep learning present powerful tools that are opening up new paradigms and opportunities in the understanding, discovery, and design of soft and biological materials. In this talk, I will first describe an approach based on latent space simulators to learn ultra-fast surrogate models of protein folding by stacking three specialized deep learning networks to (i) encode a molecular system into a slow latent space, (ii) propagate dynamics in this latent space, and (iii) generatively decode a synthetic molecular trajectory. I will then describe our recent applications of deep representational learning to expose the sequence-function relationship within homologous protein families and to use these principles for the data-driven design and experimental testing of synthetic proteins with new and/or elevated function.

## Previous Colloquium

#### Probabilistic Programming in Scientific Simulators

Date: 21-12-2021 14:00-1500 Central European Winter time

Speaker: **Atılım Güneş Baydin**

**Abstract:** <br/>

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) allow us to specify complex generative models as computer code and perform Bayesian inference in these models automatically. However, applications of these languages in the science domain remain limited because of the impracticability of rewriting complex scientific simulators in a PPL, the computational cost of inference, and the lack of scalable implementations. To address these, we present a novel probabilistic programming framework that couples directly to existing scientific simulators through a cross-platform probabilistic execution protocol and provides Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and deep-learning-based inference compilation (IC) engines for tractable inference. The talk will cover the technical details of how a PPL system can be coupled to any given simulator so that these two sides can be (1) implemented in different programming languages and (2) executed in separate processes and possibly on separate machines across a network connection. We show examples of the approach in particle physics, epidemiology, and simulation of composite materials. We show how the simulator can be replaced with a fast deep-learning-based surrogate making use of the probabilistic execution protocol and retaining the original address structure of the simulator. We also talk about technical challenges of repurposing simulators as probabilistic programs, such as dealing with very large numbers of latent variables and nested stochastic subprocedures.
