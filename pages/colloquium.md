The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested? Subscribe to our Email-list to be notified.

Speaker: **Eliu Huerta Escudero**, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

**Abstract:** <br/>
In this talk I will describe disruptive advances I have pioneered at the interface of domain-inspired AI and extreme scale computing. I will present exemplars on how to scale disruptive advances in AI, distributed computing, and scientific data infrastructure to open new pathways to conduct reproducible, accelerated, data-driven discovery.

**Bio:** <br/>
Eliu Huerta is a theoretical astrophysicist, mathematician and computer scientist with broad research interests. He has done pioneering work at the interface of domain-inspired AI and extreme scale computing for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, Cosmology, Observational Astronomy, and extreme scale simulations that describe multi-scale and multi-physics processes. He is the founding director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Head of the Gravity Group at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. He leads several NSF- and DOE-funded interdisciplinary and multi-institutional projects that focus on disruptive AI applications and advanced computing for big-data physics experiments.

## Previous Colloquia

#### e3nn: Euclidian symmetry for neural networks

Date: 02-02-2021 14:00-15:00 Central European Time

Speaker: **Mario Geiger**, PhD Student, EPFL, Lausanne

**Abstract:** <br/>
E(3) is the Euclidean group in dimension 3. That is the group of rotations, translations, and mirror. e3nn is a pytorch library that aims to create E(3) equivariant neural networks. The focus is on point clouds and recent applications have been in the realm of interatomic potential learning, phonon density of states, and to relevant benchmarks.
