Speaker: **Atılım Güneş Baydin**

**Abstract:** <br/>

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) allow us to specify complex generative models as computer code and perform Bayesian inference in these models automatically. However, applications of these languages in the science domain remain limited because of the impracticability of rewriting complex scientific simulators in a PPL, the computational cost of inference, and the lack of scalable implementations. To address these, we present a novel probabilistic programming framework that couples directly to existing scientific simulators through a cross-platform probabilistic execution protocol and provides Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and deep-learning-based inference compilation (IC) engines for tractable inference. The talk will cover the technical details of how a PPL system can be coupled to any given simulator so that these two sides can be (1) implemented in different programming languages and (2) executed in separate processes and possibly on separate machines across a network connection. We show examples of the approach in particle physics, epidemiology, and simulation of composite materials. We show how the simulator can be replaced with a fast deep-learning-based surrogate making use of the probabilistic execution protocol and retaining the original address structure of the simulator. We also talk about technical challenges of repurposing simulators as probabilistic programs, such as dealing with very large numbers of latent variables and nested stochastic subprocedures.

## Previous Colloquium

#### The Interplay of Science-Guided AI and Differentiable Simulation


Date: 23-11-2021 14:00-1500 Central European Winter time

Speaker: **Chris Rackauckas**, Applied Mathematics Instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

**Abstract:** <br/>

Science-Guided AI or Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods allow for the automatic discovery of mechanistic models by infusing neural network training into the simulation process. In this talk we will start by showcasing some of the ways that SciML is being used, from discovery of extrapolatory epidemic models to nonlinear mixed effects models in pharmacology. From there, we will discuss some of the increasingly advanced computational techniques behind the training process, focusing on the numerical issues involved in handling differentiation of highly stiff and chaotic systems. The viewers will leave with an understanding of how compiler techniques are being infused into the simulation stack to increasingly automate the process of developing mechanistic models.
