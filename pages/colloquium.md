The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested? Subscribe to our Email-list to be notified.

Speaker: **Martin van Hecke**, Leiden University

**Abstract:** <br/>

Combinatorial problems arising in puzzles, origami, and (meta)material design have rare sets of
solutions, which define complex and sharply delineated boundaries in configuration space. These
boundaries are difficult to capture with conventional statistical and numerical methods. Here we
show that convolutional neural networks can learn to recognize these boundaries, down to finest de-
tail, despite using heavily undersampled training sets, and can successfully generalize. This suggests
that the network infers the underlying combinatorial rules from the sparse training set, opening up
new possibilities for complex design of (meta)materials.

## Previous Colloquium

#### Simulation-Based Inference for Neuroscience and Beyond

Date: 07-02-2022 14:00-1500 Central European Winter time

Speaker: **Jan-Matthis Lückmann** , University of Tübingen

**Abstract:** <br/>

Science and industry make extensive use of simulations to model the world. However,
conventional statistical inference is often inapplicable to detailed simulation models because their
associated likelihood functions are intractable. In this talk, I discuss how simulation-based
inference (SBI) addresses this problem, with an emphasis on applications to biophysical models
of neural dynamics. I highlight SBI’s potential to close the gap between data-driven and theory-
driven models in neuroscience. Furthermore, I present our recently-introduced, first-ever
benchmark of SBI that compares algorithms in a transparent and reproducible way, explaining
different approaches, metrics for principled comparisons, key findings, and open challenges.

**Bio:**  <br/>
Jan-Matthis Lückmann is currently finishing his PhD in Computer Science at the University of 
Tübingen, advised by Prof. Jakob Macke. Jan-Matthis' research interests are at the intersection of 
machine learning and computational neuroscience. His expertise lies in simulation-based 
inference and its applications to mechanistic models. Jan-Matthis' work includes the proposal of 
fast and flexible inference algorithms based on neural density estimation and their applications to 
biophysical models in neuroscience. Most recently, he introduced the first-ever benchmark for the 
rapidly developing field of simulation-based inference.
