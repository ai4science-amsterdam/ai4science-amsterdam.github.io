The AI4Science Colloquium is a bi-weekly colloquium series, held on alternating Tuesdays at 14:00 Central European Time. In this colloquium our very own Teodora Pandeva and Fiona Lippert invite renowned speakers to present and discuss their state-of-the-art AI solutions for scientific discovery. Interested? Subscribe to our Email-list to be notified.

## Previous Colloquium

#### Machine Learning of Combinatorial Rules in Mechanical Metamaterials

Date: 01-03-2022 14:00-1500 Central European Winter time

Speaker: **Martin van Hecke**, Leiden University

**Abstract:** <br/>

Combinatorial problems arising in puzzles, origami, and (meta)material design have rare sets of
solutions, which define complex and sharply delineated boundaries in configuration space. These
boundaries are difficult to capture with conventional statistical and numerical methods. Here we
show that convolutional neural networks can learn to recognize these boundaries, down to finest de-
tail, despite using heavily undersampled training sets, and can successfully generalize. This suggests
that the network infers the underlying combinatorial rules from the sparse training set, opening up
new possibilities for complex design of (meta)materials.
