Speaker: **Francesca Grisoni**, Eindhoven University of Technology

**Abstract:** <br/>

Designing innovative molecules with the desired bioactivity is fundamentally a low-data problem. In fact, while the chemical universe is estimated to  contain 1023 to 10100 small molecules, humans have only discovered 104 drugs. Recent advances in deep learning have allowed for a more efficient use of available information in low-data regimes. Such technological breakthroughs have now permeated the drug discovery domain, leading to some of the first bioactive molecules designed by AI without the need of human-engineered rules. In this talk, I will focus on a particular instance of generative deep learning – the so-called chemical language models – and how they can be leveraged to accelerate de novo drug design.

## Previous Colloquium

#### Real-Time Gravitational Wave Science with Neural Posterior Estimation

Date: 26-04-2022 14:00-1500 Central European Summer time

Speaker: **Maximilian Dax**, PhD Student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems

**Abstract:** <br/>

Inferring astrophyscial parameters from gravitational wave (GW) measurements is a central task in GW analysis. Standard inference methods, based e.g. on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), require days of computation for the analysis of a single GW event. In this talk I present our new approach DINGO that reduces this inference time to 20 seconds per event by using conditional normalizing flows. I then explain how physical symmetries can be used to enhance the accuracy of the inference networks. Finally, I demonstrate on real GW event data that our likelihood-free approach produces indistinguishable results from MCMC while being 1000 times faster.
